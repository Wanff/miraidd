Therefore, let-7b-3p cannot be determined to have a causal role in Ewing sarcoma based on this abstract.",0
2,"It is not directly stated in the abstract whether hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in the disease described (hepatitis C virus-associated extrahepatic manifestation, specifically mixed cryoglobulinemia). However, as the study identified HCV-infected hepatocyte-derived exo-miRNAs (including let-7b) as a TLR7 ligand that could induce BAFF production in macrophages through exosome transmission and TLR7 activation, hsa-let-7b may indirectly contribute to the development of the disease. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in the disease described above.",0

227,"No, there is no mention of any causal intervention experiments with hsa-let-7b in the abstract. The differential expression analysis only shows that hsa-let-7b is significantly downregulated in ALL compared to AML, but this does not necessarily indicate a causal role in the disease. Therefore, hsa-let-7b does not play a causal role in ALL.",0
228,"There is no evidence in the abstract that suggests hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in frontotemporal dementia. The study only evaluated circulating miRNAs, including let-7b, as potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis of FTD, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy controls.",0
229,"Since let-7b downregulation leads to increased Dicer expression and increased cell proliferation in oral cancer cells, hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in oral cancer.",1
230,"The abstract does not provide evidence of a causal role for hsa-let-7b in type-2 diabetes. The differential expression analysis only shows decreased levels of hsa-let-7b in T2D patients compared to controls, but this alone is not sufficient to establish causality.",0
231,There is no disease described in the abstract.,0
232,"No, there is no evidence in the abstract to suggest that hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in any of the pediatric glial and mixed glioneronal tumors studied. The study focused on analyzing miRNA profiles in these tumors, and hsa-let-7b was only one of several miRNAs evaluated. Additionally, the study did not perform any causal intervention experiments with hsa-let-7b, such as transfection or knockout/knockdown experiments, and instead used differential expression analysis and computational methods.",0
233,The abstract does not provide evidence for hsa-let-7b playing a causal role in atrophic non-union.,0
234,"Since extracellular let-7b activates Toll-like receptor 7 and induces neurodegeneration through neuronal TLR7, hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in neurodegeneration.",1
235,"The abstract does not describe any disease, and there is no evidence that hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in any disease.",0
236,The abstract does not provide evidence of a causal role for hsa-let-7b in the disease described.,0
237,"It is not clear from the abstract whether hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in the disease described above, as the study primarily focuses on the regulation of FOXO3 by PRDX1 and its role in regulating the transcription of tumor suppressive miRNAs, including let-7b and let-7c. Additional information is needed to determine if let-7b is directly causal for the disease.",0
238,"There is no evidence in this abstract to suggest that hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in any disease. The abstract describes a method for detecting miRNAs, including let-7b, but does not provide any information about their causal roles.",0
239,"The abstract does not provide information about any specific disease. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in any disease based on this abstract.",0
240,There is not enough information in the abstract to determine if hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in breast- and salivary gland-derived adenoid cystic carcinomas. Differential expression analysis alone does not establish causality.,0
241,"It is not clear from the abstract whether hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The abstract suggests that hsa-let-7b has potential as a treatment response biomarker, but does not provide evidence for its causal involvement in the disease.",0
242,"No, hsa-let-7b does not play a causal role in acute myocardial infarction since the abstract only mentions its potential role as a regulator of key genes in the two biggest modules and there were no causal intervention experiments performed.",0
243,"Since the authors did not perform any experiments or provide any evidence that links hsa-let-7b to fibrosis or CKDs, hsa-let-7b does not play a causal role in the disease described above.",0
244,There is no indication in the abstract that hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in acute leukemia.,0
245,The abstract does not provide evidence for hsa-let-7b playing a causal role in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The miRNA is only mentioned as a potential diagnostic discriminatory biomarker.,0
246,"It is not clear from the abstract whether hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in pancreatic cancer. The authors did not perform any experiments using hsa-let-7b mimic or knockout to assess its impact on the disease. Instead, they reported that metformin treatment resulted in reexpression of let-7b in pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that let-7b may be a downstream target of metformin's effects on CSCs. However, without direct experimental evidence of let-7b's causal role, we cannot say for certain that it plays a causal role in pancreatic cancer.",0
247,"No, there is no mention of a disease in this abstract. Additionally, the study only identifies miRNAs present in bovine endometrium and predicts pathways they may be involved in. There is no causal intervention experiment mentioned to demonstrate a causal role.",0
248,The abstract does not provide any evidence to suggest that hsa-let-7b plays a causal role in colorectal cancer.,0
