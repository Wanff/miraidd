hsa-mir-17,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",15944709,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-23 nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate the stability or translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs. miRNAs have diverse functions, including the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Although strict tissue- and developmental-stage-specific expression is critical for appropriate miRNA function, mammalian transcription factors that regulate miRNAs have not yet been identified. The proto-oncogene c-MYC encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis. Dysregulated expression or function of c-Myc is one of the most common abnormalities in human malignancy. Here we show that c-Myc activates expression of a cluster of six miRNAs on human chromosome 13. Chromatin immunoprecipation experiments show that c-Myc binds directly to this locus. The transcription factor E2F1 is an additional target of c-Myc that promotes cell cycle progression. We find that expression of E2F1 is negatively regulated by two miRNAs in this cluster, miR-17-5p and miR-20a. These findings expand the known classes of transcripts within the c-Myc target gene network, and reveal a mechanism through which c-Myc simultaneously activates E2F1 transcription and limits its translation, allowing a tightly controlled proliferative signal.",c-Myc-regulated microRNAs modulate E2F1 expression.,yes,0.0,"Cannot determine causality from this abstract.

hsa-mir-29a,Alzheimer Disease,18434550,"Although the role of APP and PSEN genes in genetic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases is well established, fairly little is known about the molecular mechanisms affecting Abeta generation in sporadic AD. Deficiency in Abeta clearance is certainly a possibility, but increased expression of proteins like APP or BACE1/beta-secretase may also be associated with the disease. We therefore investigated changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of sporadic AD patients and found that several miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 expression appeared to be decreased in diseased brain. We show here that miR-29a, -29b-1, and -9 can regulate BACE1 expression in vitro. The miR-29a/b-1 cluster was significantly (and AD-dementia-specific) decreased in AD patients displaying abnormally high BACE1 protein. Similar correlations between expression of this cluster and BACE1 were found during brain development and in primary neuronal cultures. Finally, we provide evidence for a potential causal relationship between miR-29a/b-1 expression and Abeta generation in a cell culture model. We propose that loss of specific miRNAs can contribute to increased BACE1 and Abeta levels in sporadic AD.",Loss of microRNA cluster miR-29a/b-1 in sporadic Alzheimer's disease correlates,yes,0.0,"Yes, hsa-mir-29a plays a causal role in Alzheimer's disease as the study suggests that loss of specific miRNAs, including miR-29a, can contribute to increased BACE1 and Abeta levels in sporadic AD."
hsa-mir-143,Neoplasms [unspecific],20439436,"We studied miRNA profiles in 4419 human samples (3312 neoplastic, 1107 nonmalignant), corresponding to 50 normal tissues and 51 cancer types. The complexity of our database enabled us to perform a detailed analysis of microRNA (miRNA) activities. We inferred genetic networks from miRNA expression in normal tissues and cancer. We also built, for the first time, specialized miRNA networks for solid tumors and leukemias. Nonmalignant tissues and cancer networks displayed a change in hubs, the most connected miRNAs. hsa-miR-103/106 were downgraded in cancer, whereas hsa-miR-30 became most prominent. Cancer networks appeared as built from disjointed subnetworks, as opposed to normal tissues. A comparison of these nets allowed us to identify key miRNA cliques in cancer. We also investigated miRNA copy number alterations in 744 cancer samples, at a resolution of 150 kb. Members of miRNA families should be similarly deleted or amplified, since they repress the same cellular targets and are thus expected to have similar impacts on oncogenesis. We correctly identified hsa-miR-17/92 family as amplified and the hsa-miR-143/145 cluster as deleted. Other miRNAs, such as hsa-miR-30 and hsa-miR-204, were found to be physically altered at the DNA copy number level as well. By combining differential expression, genetic networks, and DNA copy number alterations, we confirmed, or discovered, miRNAs with comprehensive roles in cancer. Finally, we experimentally validated the miRNA network with acute lymphocytic leukemia originated in Mir155 transgenic mice. Most of miRNAs deregulated in these transgenic mice were located close to hsa-miR-155 in the cancer network.",Reprogramming of miRNA networks in cancer and leukemia.,yes,0.0,"It is not clear from the abstract whether hsa-mir-143 plays a causal role in the disease described above since the study only identified differential expression, genetic networks, and DNA copy number alterations of miRNAs in cancer, but did not perform any causal intervention experiments."
hsa-mir-31,Mesothelioma,20463022,"The human genome encodes several hundred microRNA (miRNA) genes that produce small (21-23n) single strand regulatory RNA molecules. Although abnormal expression of miRNAs has been linked to cancer progression, the mechanisms of this dysregulation are poorly understood. Malignant mesothelioma (MM) of pleura is an aggressive and highly lethal cancer resistant to conventional therapies. We and others previously linked loss of the 9p21.3 chromosome in MM with short time to tumor recurrence. In this study, we report that MM cell lines derived from patients with more aggressive disease fail to express miR-31, a microRNA recently linked with suppression of breast cancer metastases. We further demonstrate that this loss is due to homozygous deletion of the miR-31-encoding gene that resides in 9p21.3. Functional assessment of miR-31 activity revealed its ability to inhibit proliferation, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity of MM cells. Re-introduction of miR-31 suppressed the cell cycle and inhibited expression of multiple factors involved in cooperative maintenance of DNA replication and cell cycle progression, including pro-survival phosphatase PPP6C, which was previously associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy resistance, and maintenance of chromosomal stability. PPP6C, whose mRNA is distinguished with three miR-31-binding sites in its 3'-untranslated region, was consistently down-regulated by miR-31 introduction and up-regulated in clinical MM specimens as compared with matched normal tissues. Taken together, our data suggest that tumor-suppressive propensity of miR-31 can be used for development of new therapies against mesothelioma and other cancers that show loss of the 9p21.3 chromosome.",Pro-tumorigenic effects of miR-31 loss in mesothelioma.,yes,0.0,"No, hsa-mir-31 does not play a causal role in mesothelioma. While it is linked to tumor suppression and loss of its expression is associated with more aggressive disease, reintroducing it in MM cells inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenicity. Therefore, its loss may contribute to tumorigenesis but it is not the primary cause of mesothelioma."
hsa-mir-29a,"Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute",20628397,"BACKGROUND: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (CEBPA) is crucial for normal granulopoiesis and is frequently disrupted in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Increasing evidence suggests that CEBPA exerts its effects, in parts, by regulating specific microRNAs (miRNAs), as previously shown for miR-223. The aim of this study was to investigate the genome-wide pattern of miRNAs regulated by CEBPA in myeloid cells. METHODS: In Kasumi-1 cells, conditionally expressing CEBPA, we assessed the expression of 470 human miRNAs by microarray analysis. We further investigated the microarray results by qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: In all, 18 miRNAs were more than two-fold suppressed or induced after CEBPA restoration. Among these 18 miRNAs, we focused on CEBPA-mediated regulation of the tumour-suppressive miR-29b. We observed that miR-29b is suppressed in AML patients with impaired CEBPA function or loss of chromosome 7q. We found that CEBPA selectively regulates miR-29b expression on its miR-29a/b1 locus on chromosome 7q32.3, whereas miR-29b2/c on chromosome 1q32.2 is not affected. CONCLUSION: This study reports the activation of the tumour-suppressive miR-29b by the haematopoietic key transcription factor CEBPA. Our data provide a rationale for miR-29b suppression in AML patients with loss of chromosome 7q or CEBPA deficiency.",The tumour-suppressive miR-29a/b1 cluster is regulated by CEBPA and blocked in,yes,0.0,"There isn't enough evidence in the abstract to determine whether hsa-mir-29a plays a causal role in the described disease (acute myeloid leukemia).

hsa-mir-107,Urinary Bladder Cancer,21388952,"Activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors in urothelium is considered critical for development of urothelial cancer. Here we report cloning of the urothelium-specific promoter uroplakin-II (UPK II) and generation of transgenic mice in which expression of SV40 large T antigen is driven by UPK II promoter. Inactivation of tumor suppressor p53 and pRb in urothelium by SV40 T antigen resulted in urothelial carcinoma, resembling human high-grade carcinoma in situ. Specific deletion of p53 in urothelial cells using the newly generated UPK II-Cre mice results in normal bladders without any evidence of cancer. The high-grade carcinoma in situ in the UPK II-SV40 mice is associated with significant activation of angiogenic signals consisting of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and VEGF and a down-regulation of thrombospondin-1. Interestingly, such pro-angiogenic activity was not associated with progression to invasive cancer. Analysis of bladder-associated microRNAs in carcinoma in situ lesions reveals a pro-angiogenic profile, with specific overexpression of miR-18a and miR-19a and down-regulation of miR-107. A group of microRNAs (miRs) identified as associated with invasive human urothelial cancer remained unchanged in this mouse model. Collectively, our results support the notion that activation of angiogenesis and loss of p53 are not sufficient for progression to invasive cancer.

hsa-mir-132,Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,21807765,"Tauopathies represent a large class of neurological and movement disorders characterized by abnormal intracellular deposits of the microtubule-associated protein tau. It is now well established that mis-splicing of tau exon 10, causing an imbalance between three-repeat (3R) and four-repeat (4R) tau isoforms, can cause disease; however, the underlying mechanisms affecting tau splicing in neurons remain poorly understood. The small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), known for their critical role in posttranscriptional gene expression regulation, are increasingly acknowledged as important regulators of alternative splicing. Here, we identified a number of brain miRNAs, including miR-124, miR-9, miR-132 and miR-137, which regulate 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, a major 4R-tau tauopathy, showed that miR-132 is specifically down-regulated in disease. We demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies.",MicroRNA-132 loss is associated with tau exon 10 inclusion in progressive,yes,0.0,"Since the downregulation of hsa-mir-132 is associated with abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 and an increase in the 4R:3R-tau isoform ratio, which can cause progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), hsa-mir-132 plays a causal role in PSP."

hsa-mir-144,Thyroid Neoplasms,22049245,"The molecular determinants of thyroid follicular nodules are incompletely understood and assessment of malignancy is a diagnostic challenge. Since microRNA (miRNA) analyses could provide new leads to malignant progression, we characterised the global miRNA expression in follicular adenoma (FA) and follicular carcinoma (FC). Comparison of carcinoma and adenoma with normal thyroid revealed 150 and 107 differentially expressed miRNAs respectively. Most miRNAs were down-regulated and especially miR-199b-5p and miR-144 which were essentially lost in the carcinomas. Integration of the changed miRNAs with differentially expressed mRNAs demonstrated an enrichment of seed sites among up-regulated transcripts encoding proteins implicated in thyroid tumourigenesis. This was substantiated by the demonstration that pre-miR-199b reduced proliferation when added to cultured follicular thyroid carcinoma cells. The down-regulated miRNAs in FC exhibited a substantial similarity with down-regulated miRNAs in anaplastic carcinoma (AC) and by gene set enrichment analysis, we observed a significant identity between target mRNAs in FC and transcripts up-regulated in AC. To examine the diagnostic potential of miRNA expression pattern in distinguishing malignant from benign nodules we employed a supervised learning algorithm and leave-one-out-cross-validation. By this procedure, FA and FC were identified with a negative predicted value of 83% (data generated by microarray platform) and of 92% (data generated by qRT-PCR platform).

METHODS: Expression of the miR-34 family in synovial fibroblasts with or without stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), hypoxia, or 5-azacytidine was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Promoter methylation was studied by combined bisulfite restriction analysis. The effects of overexpression and silencing of miR-34a and miR-34a* on apoptosis were analyzed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Production of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was assessed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. Reporter gene assay was used to study the signaling pathways of miR-34a*. RESULTS: Basal expression levels of miR-34a* were found to be reduced in synovial fibroblasts from RA patients compared to osteoarthritis patients, whereas levels of miR-34a, miR-34b/b*, and miR-34c/c* did not differ. Neither TNFα, IL-1β, TLR ligands, nor hypoxia altered miR-34a* expression. However, we demonstrated that the promoter of miR-34a/34a* was methylated and showed that transcription of the miR-34a duplex was induced upon treatment with demethylating agents. Enforced expression of miR-34a* led to an increased rate of FasL- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in RASFs. Moreover, levels of miR-34a* were highly correlated with expression of XIAP, which was found to be up-regulated in RA synovial cells. Finally, we identified XIAP as a direct target of miR-34a*.

Laser-capture microdissection of stromal cells from normal tissue and endometrial cancer confirmed this observation. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-deoxycytidine stimulated the expression of miR-148a in the majority of CAFs implicating DNA methylation in the regulation of miR-148a expression. Investigation of miR-148a function in fibroblasts demonstrated that conditioned media (CM) from CAFs overexpressing miR-148a significantly impaired the migration of five endometrial cancer cell lines without affecting their growth rates in co-culture experiments. Among predicted miR-148a target genes are two WNT family members, WNT1 and WNT10B. Activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway in CAFs was confirmed by microarray analysis of gene expression and increased activity of the SuperTOPFlash luciferase reporter. We found elevated levels of WNT10B protein in CAFs and its level decreased when miR-148a was re-introduced by lentiviral infection. The 3'-UTR of WNT10B, cloned downstream of luciferase cDNA, suppressed luciferase activity when co-expressed with miR-148a indicating that WNT10B is a direct target of miR-148a.

However, its role in human prostate cancer (PCa) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate miR-126 expression in PCa and its prognostic value for PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. METHODS: A series of 128 cases with PCa were evaluated for the expression levels of miR-126 by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the correlation between miR-126 expression and prognosis of PCa patients. RESULTS: Compared with non-cancerous prostate tissues, the expression level of miR-126 was significantly decreased in PCa tissues (PCa vs. non-cancerous prostate: 1.05 ± 0.63 vs. 2.92 ± 0.98, P < 0.001). Additionally, the loss of miR-126 expression was dramatically associated with aggressive clinical pathological features, including advanced pathological stage (P = 0.001), positive lymph node metastasis (P = 0.006), high preoperative PSA (P = 0.003) and positive angiolymphatic invasion (P = 0.001). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that PCa patients with low miR-126 expression have shorter biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival than those with high miR-126 expression.

Starting from functional investigations of a rare SNP upstream the miR cluster, we identified a novel allele-specific mechanism that exploits a cryptic activator region to recruit the RNA polymerase III for miR-15a/16-1 transcription. This regulation of the miR-15a/16- locus is independent of the DLEU2 host gene, which is often transcribed monoallellically by RPII. We found that normally one allele of miR-15a/16-1 is transcribed by RNAPII, the other one by RNAPIII. In our subset of CLL patients harboring 13q14 deletions, exclusive RNA polymerase III (RPIII)-driven transcription of the miR-15a/16-1 was the consequence of loss of the RPII-regulated allele and correlated with high expression of the poor prognostic marker ZAP70 (P=0.019). Thus, our findings point to a novel biological process, characterized by double allele-specific transcriptional regulation of the miR-15a/16-1 locus by alternative mechanisms. Differential usage of these mechanisms may distinguish at onset aggressive from indolent forms of CLL. This provides a basis for the clinical heterogeneity of the CLL patients carrying 13q14 deletions.",Allele-specific loss and transcription of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster in chronic,yes,0.0,"Yes, hsa-mir-15a plays a causal role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as deregulation of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster has a key role in the pathogenesis of CLL.

hsa-mir-21,Pulmonary Hypertension,24732886,"Pulmonary endothelial cell apoptosis is a transient, yet defining pathogenic event integral to the onset of many pulmonary vascular diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, there is a paucity of information concerning the molecular pathway(s) that control pulmonary arterial endothelial cell apoptosis. Here, we introduce a molecular axis that when functionally active seems to induce pulmonary arterial endothelial cell apoptosis in vitro and PH in vivo. In response to apoptotic stimuli, human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells exhibited robust induction of a programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4)/caspase-3/apoptotic pathway that was reversible by direct PDCD4 silencing. Indirectly, this pathway was also repressed by delivery of a microRNA-21 mimic. In vivo, genetic deletion of microRNA-21 in mice (miR-21(-/-) mice) resulted in functional activation of the PDCD4/caspase-3 axis in the pulmonary tissues, leading to the onset of progressive PH. Conversely, microRNA-21-overexpressing mice (CAG-microRNA-21 mice) exhibited reduced PDCD4 expression in pulmonary tissues and were partially resistant to PH in response to chronic hypoxia plus SU 5416 injury. Furthermore, direct PDCD4 knockout in mice (PDCD4(-/-) mice) potently blocked pulmonary caspase-3 activation and the development of chronic hypoxia plus SU 5416 PH, confirming its importance in disease onset. Broadly, these findings support the existence of a microRNA-21-responsive PDCD4/caspase-3 pathway in the pulmonary tissues that when active serves to promote endothelial apoptosis in vitro and PH in vivo.",Endothelial apoptosis in pulmonary hypertension is controlled by a,yes,0.0,"No, hsa-mir-21 does not play a causal role in pulmonary hypertension described in the abstract.

We studied the effect of miR-204 modulation on master transcription factors important for lineage development, cell differentiation and prostate cancer bone marrow metastasis. We followed c-MYB, ETS1 and RUNX2 transcript and protein expression and the miR-204 affected global proteome. We further investigated if these transcription factors exert an effect on miR-204 expression (qPCR, luciferase reporter assay) by silencing them using esiRNA. We found dualistic miR-204 effects, either acting as a tumor suppressor on c-MYB, or as an oncomiR on ETS1. RUNX2 and ETS1 regulation by miR-204 was ERG fusion dependent, demonstrating regulatory circuitry disruption in advanced metastatic models. miR-204 also differentially affected mRNA splicing and protein stability. miR-204 levels were found dependent on cancer hypermethylation and supported by positive feedback induced by all three transcription factors. In this regulatory circuitry among miR-204, c-MYB, RUNX2 and ETS1, the c-MYB was found to induce all three other members, but its expression was differentially affected by the methylation status in lymph node vs. bone metastasis.

These molecules circulate freely in the blood and their expression is associated with the progression of different vascular pathologies. Here, we studied the expression profile of circulating miRNAs in 12 well-characterized IPAH patients using microarrays.

However, the mechanistic pathways that link both disorders are essentially unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our study was designed to investigate the role of microRNA-21 in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and its potential involvement in HCC. METHODS: Wildtype mice maintained on a high fat diet (HFD) received tail vein injections of microRNA-21-anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) or miR-21 mismatched ASO for 4 or 8 weeks. Livers were collected after that time period for lipid content and gene expression analysis. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells incubated with oleate were used to study the role of miR-21 in lipogenesis and analysed with Nile-Red staining. microRNA-21 function in carcinogenesis was determined by soft-agar colony formation, cell cycle analysis and xenograft tumour assay using HepG2 cells. RESULTS: The expression of microRNA-21 was increased in the livers of HFD-treated mice and human HepG2 cells incubated with fatty acid. MicroRNA-21 knockdown in those mice and HepG2 cells impaired lipid accumulation and growth of xenograft tumour. Further studies revealed that Hbp1 was a novel target of microRNA-21 and a transcriptional activator of p53. It is well established that p53 is a tumour suppressor and an inhibitor of lipogenesis by inhibiting Srebp1c. As expected, microRNA-21 knockdown led to increased HBP1 and p53 and subsequently reduced lipogenesis and delayed G1/S transition, and the additional treatment of HBP1-siRNA antagonised the effect of microRNA-21-ASO, suggesting that HBP1 mediated the inhibitory effects of microRNA-21-ASO on both hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatocarcinogenesis. Mechanistically, microRNA-21 knockdown induced p53 transcription, which subsequently reduced expression of genes controlling lipogenesis and cell cycle transition. In contrast, the opposite result was observed with overexpression of microRNA-21, which prevented p53 transcription.

Wild type (WT) and miR-150 null mutant (miR-150-/-) male mice were given a HFD (59% fat calories) or normal chow diet. Chronic HFD caused a decrease of serum miR-150 in WT mice. Mice on HFD for 7 months (both WT and miR-150-/-) had significant decreases in retinal light responses measured by electroretinograms (ERGs). The retinal neovascularization in miR-150-/--HFD mice was significantly higher compared to their age matched WT-HFD mice, which indicates that miR-150 null mutation exacerbates chronic HFD-induced neovascularization in the retina.

We found that miR-27a was markedly downregulated in the serum, synovial tissue, and FLS of RA patients. Meanwhile, the expression of follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1) was upregulated, which suggests that FSTL1 plays a key role in RA development. The results of a Transwell assay showed that miR-27a inhibited FLS migration and invasion. However, miR-27a inhibition promoted the migration and invasion of FLS. In addition, the down-regulated expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2, MMP9, and MMP13) and Rho family proteins (Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA) was detected after treatment with miR-27a in RA-FLS by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analysis. Then, a luciferase reporter assay validated that miR-27a targeted the 3-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of FSTL1. Moreover, miR-27a caused a significant decrease of FSTL1.

Specific silencing of mRNA expression by small interfering RNA against GW182 significantly decreased HCV RNA and protein expression. Overexpression of GW182 significantly increased HCV RNA and protein expression in HCV J6/JFH1 infected Huh7.5 cells.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genomic aberrations, let-7a3/let-7b miRNA and HMGA2 expression in AT/RT tissues were identified using quantitative PCR, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry. The impact of let-7b miRNA on HMGA2 expression and the malignant potential of human rhabdoid tumor cell G401 (SMARCB1(-/-)) were investigated by antisense inhibition and ectopic overexpression studies. RESULTS: The copy number of let-7a3/let-7b miRNA was substantially decreased in 4 of 11 AT/RT samples. A significantly inverse correlation between let-7a3/let-7b miRNA expression and HMGA2 mRNA expression was observed in AT/RT tissues (R = -0.34; P < 0.05).

Nitidine Chloride (NC), a natural bioactive alkaloid, is suggested to possess anti-tumor effects. However, the function of NC in leukemia and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been established. In this study, we found that NC induced erythroid differentiation, accompanied by increased expression of erythroid differentiation markers, e. g. α-, ε-, γ-globin, CD235a, CD71 and α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) in CML cells. We also observed that NC induced apoptosis and upregulated cleaved caspase-3 and Parp-1 in K562 cells. These effects were associated with concomitant attenuation of c-Myc. Our study showed that NC treatment in CML cells enhanced phosphorylation of Thr58 residue and subsequently accelerated degradation of c-Myc. A specific group of miRNAs, which had been reported to be activated by c-Myc, mediated biological functions of c-Myc. We found that most of these miRNAs, especially miR-17 and miR-20a showed strong decrement after NC treatment or c-Myc interference. Furthermore, overexpression of c-Myc or miR-17/20a alleviated NC induced differentiation and apoptosis in K562 cells. More importantly, NC enhanced the effects of imatinib in K562 and primary CML cells. We further found that even imatinib resistant CML cell line (K562/G01) and CML primary cells exhibited high sensitivity to NC, which showed potential possibility to overcome imatinib resistance.

Recent works have underlined the involvement of non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer development, with several conjectures regarding their possible involvement in the evolution of drug resistance. This work was aimed to identify selected microRNAs involved in the development of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. METHODS: High-throughput analysis of the miRNA profile in a panel of paclitaxel- (A2780TAX, A2780TC1 and A2780TC3) and cisplatin-resistant (A2780CIS) cells was assessed using a microarray platform and subsequent validation with qPCR and Northern blots.

Let-7e was upregulated in A2780TAX cells, while it was downregulated in the other resistant cell lines.

The miR-30c, miR-130a and miR-335 were downregulated in all the resistant cell lines, thereby suggesting a direct involvement in the development of chemoresistance. Finally downstream target validation was proven for the miR-130a, whose downregulation was linked to the translational activation of the M-CSF gene, a known resistance factor for ovarian cancer.

We then investigated the mechanism of endothelial proliferation in senile hemangioma, focusing on microRNA (miRNA). miRNA PCR array analysis revealed the mir-424 level in senile hemangioma was lower than in other vascular anomalies. Protein expression of MEK1 and cyclin E1, the predicted target genes of mir-424, was increased in senile hemangioma compared to normal skin or other anomalies, but their mRNA levels were not. The inhibition of mir-424 in normal human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) using specific inhibitor in vitro resulted in the increase of protein expression of MEK1 or cyclin E1, while mRNA levels were not affected by the inhibitor. Specific inhibitor of mir-424 also induced the cell proliferation of HDMECs significantly, while the cell number was decreased by the transfection of siRNA for MEK1 or cyclin E1.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We found that microRNA-503 (miR-503) expression in ECs is upregulated in culture conditions mimicking diabetes mellitus (high D-glucose) and ischemia-associated starvation (low growth factors). Under normal culture conditions, lentivirus-mediated miR-503-forced expression inhibited EC proliferation, migration, and network formation on Matrigel (comparisons versus lentivirus.GFP control). Conversely, blocking miR-503 activity by either adenovirus-mediated transfer of a miR-503 decoy (Ad.decoymiR-503) or by antimiR-503 (antisense oligonucleotide) improved the functional capacities of ECs cultured under high D-glucose/low growth factors. We identified CCNE1 and cdc25A as direct miR-503 targets which are downregulated by high glucose/low growth factors in ECs. Next, we obtained evidence that miR-503 expression is increased in ischemic limb muscles of streptozotocin-diabetic mice and in ECs enriched from these muscles. Moreover, Ad.decoymiR-503 delivery to the ischemic adductor of diabetic mice corrected diabetes mellitus-induced impairment of postischemic angiogenesis and blood flow recovery. We finally investigated miR-503 and target gene expression in muscular specimens from the amputated ischemic legs of diabetic patients. As controls, calf biopsies of nondiabetic and nonischemic patients undergoing saphenous vein stripping were used. In diabetic muscles, miR-503 expression was remarkably higher, and it inversely correlated with cdc25 protein expression. Plasma miR-503 levels were also elevated in the diabetic individuals.

Differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells before and after TPL treatment were identified using microarrays and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: TPL 20-160 nmol/L treatment potently inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in T-cell lymphocytic leukemia cell lines. Molt-4 and Jurkat cells, however, were more sensitive to TPL than L428 and Raji cells. After 24 h of treatment, bortezomib abrogated the growth of Molt-4 and Jurkat cells with an IC(50) of 15.25 and 24.68 nmol/L, respectively.

In the present study, using a highly sensitive microarray-based approach, we identified 11 miRNAs with differential expression between Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) from experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) rats and control rats. miR-145 is one of the most significantly down-regulated miRNAs in PBMC from EAMG rats. Down-regulation of miR-145 expression was confirmed in PBMC and CD4+CD25- T cells (T effector cells) from both EAMG rats and MG patients by real-time PCR. Bioinformatics target prediction identified two crucial immune-related molecules-CD28 and NFATc1, as putative targets of miR-145.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of diabetes alone significantly decreased both angiomiRs in the plasma and the myocardium. The down-regulation of angiomiRs was also associated with reduced capillaries and arterioles and increased endothelial cell apoptosis, the hallmark of microangiopathy.

Total RNA was extracted from K562, HL-60, NB-4 and HeLa cell lines, white blood cells of peripheral blood from patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and mobilized white blood cells of peripheral blood from normal persons, respectively. Total RNA was polyadenylated by poly (A) polymerases and the expressions of miR-17-19b in the cell lines and the above mentioned cells were detected by SYBR-green real-time PCR. The K562 cell line was treated with 2.5 µmol/L 5-aza for 24, 48 and 72 hours, then were collected at 96 hours. The changes of miR-17-19b expression were determined by real-time PCR after 5-aza treatment. K562 cell line proliferation was observed after inhibition of miR-19a function.

In this study, the expression of miR-191 and miR-425 in GC tissue and serum was assessed, and the relationship between miRNA expression and clinicopathological data was analyzed. We found that miR-191 and miR-425 were both significantly increased in human GC tissues relative to adjacent normal controls.

However, how serum miR-21 changes during the HCC formation and whether miR-21 plays a regulatory role in this whole process are unknown. The current study evaluated the prognostic and diagnostic potential of serum miR-21 in HCC patients. Next, we established a HCC rat model and collected the blood and liver tissues at regular time points. AFP from the serum, RNA from the serum and liver tissues were collected and quantified separately. The results revealed that tissue and serum miR-21 was upregulated significantly in the groups of cirrhosis, early and advanced HCC compared with normal and fibrosis groups.

Then, the changes of miR-21 downstream proteins (i.e., programmed cell death 4 [PDCD4] and phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN]) in the liver tissues were measured. PDCD4 and PTEN expression was decreased gradually after tumor induction and negatively correlated with miR-21 expression. All these results suggested that serum miR-21 was associated with the prognosis of HCC; the changes in serum miR-21 were earlier and more accurately reflected the pathogenesis of HCC than AFP; therefore, it could be used as an early diagnostic marker for HCC.

In this study, we found that the high level of RAGE expression in 29 pairs of paraffin-embedded ESCC tissues was correlated positively with the depth of invasion by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that RAGE was involved in ESCC. We used bioinformatics searches and luciferase reporter assays to investigate the prediction that RAGE was regulated directly by miR-185. Besides, overexpression of miR-185 in ESCC cells was accompanied by 27% (TE-11) and 49% (Eca-109) reduced RAGE expression. The effect was further confirmed in RAGE protein by immunofluorescence in both cell lines. The effects were reversed following cotransfection with miR-185 and high-level expression of the RAGE vector. Furthermore, the biological role of miR-185 in ESCC cell lines was investigated using assays of cell viability, Ki-67 staining, and cell migration and invasion, as well as in a xenograft model. We found that overexpression of miR-185 inhibited migration and invasion by ESCC cells in vitro and reduced their capacity to develop distal pulmonary metastases in vivo partly through the RAGE/heat shock protein 27 pathway. Interestingly, in clinical specimens, the level of plasma miR-185 expression was decreased significantly (P = 0.002) in patients with ESCC [0.500; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.248-1.676] compared with healthy controls (2.410; 95% CI 0.612-5.671).

There is growing body of evidence showing the important role of miR-486-5p and miR-938 for discrimination of PDAC patients from healthy subjects and those with chronic pancreatitis. Additionally the diagnostic features of miR-486-5p were comparable with CA 19-9 for the detection of PDAC patients, suggesting its diagnostic value as a blood-based miRNA in PDAC, although further investigations are warranted for validation of this marker.

However, the identity of the ex-RNA responsible for the proinflammatory effect remains unclear. In the current study, using an miRNA array, we profiled the plasma miRNAs 4 h after transient myocardial ischemia (45 min) or sham procedure. Among 38 plasma miRNAs that were elevated following ischemia, eight were tested for their ability to induce cytokine response in macrophages and cardiomyocytes. We found that six miRNA mimics (miR-34a, -122, -133a, -142, -146a, and -208a) induced cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of miRNAs (miR-133a, -146a, and -208a) were diminished by uridine→adenosine mutation and by RNase pretreatment. The miRNA-induced cytokine (MIP-2, TNF-α, and IL-6) production was abolished in cells deficient of TLR7 or MyD88, or by a TLR7 antagonist, but remained the same in TLR3- or Trif-deficient cells. In vivo, mice i.p. injected with miR-133a or miR-146a had marked peritoneal neutrophil and monocyte migration, which was significantly attenuated in TLR7(-/-) mice. Moreover, locked nucleic acid anti-miRNA inhibitors of these six miRNAs markedly reduced cardiac RNA-induced cytokine production.

METHODS: Using a TaqMan miRNA assay system, we measured miR-212 expression levels in colon biopsy samples from patients with ALD and in Caco-2 cells (a human intestinal epithelial cell line) treated with or without EtOH. We measured ZO-1 protein levels using western blots. ZO-1 mRNA was assayed using real-time PCR. Intestinal barrier integrity was measured using fluorescein sulfonic acid clearance and immunofluorescent staining for ZO-1. RESULTS: Ethanol increased miR-212 expression, decreased ZO-1 protein levels, disrupted tight junctions, and increased the permeability of monolayers of Caco-2 cells. An miR-212 over-expression is correlated with hyperpermeability of the monolayer barrier. miR-212 levels were higher in colon biopsy samples in patients with ALD than in healthy controls; ZO-1 protein levels were lower. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a novel mechanism for alcohol-induced gut leakiness, one in which EtOH induces miR-212 over-expression which causes gut leakiness by down-regulating ZO-1 translation. This mechanism is a potential therapeutic target for leaky gut in patients with or at risk for ALD.",Effect of alcohol on miR-212 expression in intestinal epithelial cells and its potential role in alcoholic liver disease.,no,1.0,"Yes, hsa-mir-212 plays a causal role in alcoholic liver disease by inducing gut leakiness and down-regulating ZO-1 translation."

Such miRNAs, which act directly as repressors of gene expression, have been found to frequently reside in fragile sites and genomic regions associated with cancer.

Moreover, two known oncomiRs--miRNAs with known roles in cancer--the miR-17-92 polycistron and miR-21, exhibited increased expression in 100% of primary human and woodchuck hepatocellular carcinomas surveyed. To determine the importance of these miRNAs in tumorigenesis, an in vitro antisense oligonucleotide knockdown model was evaluated for its ability to reverse the malignant phenotype. Both in human and woodchuck HCC cell lines, separate treatments with antisense oligonucleotides specific for either the miR-17-92 polycistron (all six members) or miR-21 caused a 50% reduction in both hepatocyte proliferation and anchorage-independent growth.

Over time, however, virtually all CLL patients become fludarabine-refractory. To elucidate whether microRNAs are involved in the development of fludarabine resistance, we analyzed the expression of 723 human miRNAs before and 5-days after fludarabine mono-therapy in 17 CLL patients which were classified as responder or refractory to fludarabine treatment based on NCI criteria. RESULTS: By comparing the expression profiles of these two groups of patients, we identified a microRNA signature able to distinguish refractory from sensitive CLLs. The expression of some microRNAs was also able to predict fludarabine resistance of 12 independent CLL patients. Among the identified microRNAs, miR-148a, miR-222 and miR-21 exhibited a significantly higher expression in non-responder patients either before and after fludarabine treatment.

hsa-mir-224,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,23199328,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with abnormal T cell immune responses. We hypothesized that aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE. First, we analysed the expression profiles of 270 human miRNAs in T cells from five SLE patients and five healthy controls and then validated those potentially aberrant-expressed miRNAs using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then, the expression of mRNAs regulated by these aberrant-expressed miRNAs was detected using real-time PCR. Finally, miRNA transfection into Jurkat T cells was conducted for confirming further the biological functions of these miRNAs. The initial analysis indicated that seven miRNAs, including miR-145, miR-224, miR-513-5p, miR-150, miR-516a-5p, miR-483-5p and miR-629, were found to be potentially abnormally expressed in SLE T cells. After validation, under-expressed miR-145 and over-expressed miR-224 were noted. We further found that STAT1 mRNA targeted by miR-145 was over-expressed and apoptosis inhibitory protein 5 (API5) mRNA targeted by miR-224 was under-expressed in SLE T cells. Transfection of Jurkat cells with miR-145 suppressed STAT1 and miR-224 transfection suppressed API5 protein expression.

hsa-mir-146b,Acute Kidney Failure,27400799,": The role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in kidney injury repair has been studied widely. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. We profiled the altered microRNAs in renal tissues from cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) rats treated with or without rat bone marrow MSCs (rMSCs). We observed that microRNA-146b (miR-146b) expression was considerably upregulated in renal tissues from AKI rats compared with that in healthy rats, and the expression decreased following MSC treatment after cisplatin administration. At the early stage of AKI, serum miR-146b levels exhibited a rapid increase that was even faster than that of two conventional renal function indexes: serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Furthermore, the serum miR-146b levels in AKI patients were higher than those in healthy people. In vitro exposure to cisplatin also increased miR-146b expression in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). miR-146b knockdown protected renal TECs from cisplatin-induced apoptosis and promoted their proliferation. Moreover, ErbB4 was identified as a direct target of miR-146b, and miR-146b inhibition induced ErbB4 expression, resulting in enhanced proliferation of injured renal TECs. In addition, restoration by rMSCs could be controlled through ErbB4 downregulation. In conclusion, elevated miR-146b expression contributes to cisplatin-induced AKI, partly through ErbB4 downregulation. miR-146b might be an early biomarker for AKI, and miR-146b inhibition could be a novel strategy for AKI treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study found that microRNA-146b (miR-146b) might be a novel biomarker for acute kidney injury and an indicator for its recovery after treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The results showed that in acute kidney injury induced by cisplatin, miR-146b in serum increased more quickly than did the usual indexes of kidney injury and decreased with restoration of MSCs. In addition, inhibition of miR-146b could ameliorate the apoptosis induced by cisplatin and potentially improve the proliferation by freeing ErbB4 and its downstream proteins.","MicroRNA-146b, a Sensitive Indicator of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Repair of Acute Renal Injury.",no,1.0,"Since the authors showed that inhibition of hsa-mir-146b protected renal TECs from cisplatin-induced apoptosis and promoted their proliferation and that hsa-mir-146b levels increased in AKI rats and AKI patients, hsa-mir-146b plays a causal role in acute kidney injury."

Cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus impair PAC regenerative capacities via molecular mechanisms that are not fully known. We hypothesize a role for microRNAs (miRs). Circulating miRs are currently investigated as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were the following: (1) to profile miR expression in PACs from critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients; (2) to demonstrate that miR-15a and miR-16 regulate PAC functions; and (3) to characterize circulating miR-15a and miR-16 and to investigate their potential biomarker value. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight miRs potentially able to modulate angiogenesis were measured in PACs from CLI patients with and without diabetes mellitus and controls. miR-15a and miR-16 were further analyzed. CLI-PACs expressed higher level of mature miR-15a and miR-16 and of the primary transcript pri-miR-15a/16-1. miR-15a/16 overexpression impaired healthy PAC survival and migration. Conversely, miR-15a/16 inhibition improved CLI-PAC-defective migration. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A and AKT-3 were validated as direct targets of the 2 miRs, and their protein levels were reduced in miR-15a/16-overexpressing healthy PACs and in CLI-PACs. Transplantation of healthy PACs ex vivo-engineered with anti-miR-15a/16 improved postischemic blood flow recovery and muscular arteriole density in immunodeficient mice. miR-15a and miR-16 were present in human blood, including conjugated to argonaute-2 and in exosomes. Both miRs were increased in the serum of CLI patients and positively correlated with amputation after restenosis at 12 months postrevascularization of CLI type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
