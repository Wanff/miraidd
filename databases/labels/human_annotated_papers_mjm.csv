Comparison of Expression Levels of miR-29b-3p and miR-326 in T Helper-1 and T Helper-17 Cells Isolated from Responsive and Non-responsive Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated with Interferon-beta.,"T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 Cells with distinct cytokine profiles including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) have a pivotal role in neuroinflammation and myelin destruction in the central nervous system (CNS) in MS. MicroRNA-29b (MiR-29b) and miR-326 contribute to regulating Th1 and Th17 differentiation and altered expression of the miRNAs could be associated with response to treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the percentage of Th1 and Th17 and determining the expression levels of miR-29b-3p and miR-326 in these lymphocyte subpopulations between responsive and non-responsive to interferon beta (IFN-beta) therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. The present study was performed on 40 RRMS patients following treatment with IFN-beta. The percentage of Th1 cells and Th17 cells were determined by flow cytometry in responsive and non-responsive patients. The expression levels of miR-29b-3p and miR-326 were assessed in Th1 and Th17 cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to evaluate the plasma levels of IFN-gamma and IL-17A. No significant difference was observed in the percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells as well as the expression levels of miR-29b-3p and miR-326 (in Th1 and Th17, respectively) in treated patients. Also, we did not find any significant difference in IFN-gamma and IL-17A plasma concentration between responsive or non-responsive to IFN-beta therapy in patients with RRMS. IFN-beta may regulate other miRNAs in Th1 and Th17 cells than miR29b-3p and miR-326 in MS patients.",2020 Aug 25,"['Biomarkers', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",33463108,hsa-mir-326,no,
MicroRNA expression profile in plasma from type 1 diabetic patients: Case-control,"AIMS: To investigate a miRNA expression profile in plasma of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) patients and control subjects and analyze the putative pathways involved. METHODS: Expressions of 48 miRNAs were analyzed in plasma of 33 T1DM patients and 26 age-and-gender-matched controls using Stem-loop RT-PreAmp PCR and TaqMan Low Density Arrays (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Five dysregulated miRNAs were then chosen for validation in an independent sample of 27 T1DM patients and 14 controls, using RT-qPCR. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to determine in which pathways these miRNAs are involved. RESULTS: Nine miRNAs were differentially expressed between recently-diagnosed T1DM patients (<5 years of diagnosis) and controls. No differences were observed between patients with ѓ?ќ5 years of diagnosis and controls. After validation in an independent sample of T1DM patients, miR-103a-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-200a-3p, and miR-210-3p were confirmed as being upregulated in recently-diagnosed T1DM patients compared with controls or patients with ѓ?ќ5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, miR-146a-5p was downregulated in recently-diagnosed T1DM patients compared with the other groups. These five miRNAs regulate several genes from innate immune system-, MAPK-, apoptosis-, insulin- and cancer-related pathways. CONCLUSION: Five miRNAs are dysregulated in recently-diagnosed T1DM patients and target several genes involved in pathways related to T1DM pathogenesis, thus representing potential T1DM biomarkers.",2018,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",29679626,hsa-mir-200a,no,
A Systematic Review of Esophageal MicroRNA Markers for Diagnosis and Monitoring,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal epithelial microRNAs may be used to diagnose Barrett's esophagus (BE) and possibly monitor its progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). AIMS: We reviewed studies that have investigated this to identify microRNAs with high biomarker potential for screening and disease monitoring in BE. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies that quantified esophageal epithelial microRNAs. Publications reporting microRNA comparisons of normal, non-dysplastic BE, BE with high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and EAC tissues using both unbiased discovery and independent validation phases were reviewed. RESULTS: Eleven studies on microRNA expression differences between normal epithelium and non-dysplastic BE (seven studies), HGD (4) or EAC (7), or between non-dysplastic BE and HGD (3) or EAC (6) were identified, and the findings of their validation phase were analyzed. Increased miR-192, -194, and -215, and reduced miR-203 and -205 expression in BE compared to normal was noticed by all 4-6 of the seven studies that examined these microRNAs. In heterogeneity tests of the reported fold-change values, the I (2) statistics were 7.9-17.1 % (all P < 0.05). Elevated miR-192, -194, and -215, and diminished miR-203 and -205 levels were also noted for comparisons of HGD or EAC against normal. In contrast, a consistent microRNA expression difference was absent for the comparisons of HGD or EAC against BE. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs miR-192, -194, -203, -205, and -215 are promising tissue biomarkers for diagnosing BE. Cross-sectional data suggest that microRNAs may have a limited role in separating BE from HGD/EAC epithelia but need further testing in longitudinal follow-up studies.",2016,"['Adenocarcinoma/etiology/*metabolism', 'Barrett Esophagus/complications/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/etiology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism']",26572780,hsa-mir-192,no,
Regulatory Axis of miR-195/497 and HMGA1-Id3 Governs Muscle Cell Proliferation,"Myocytes withdraw from the cell cycle to differentiate during muscle development. Given the capacity of microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate gene expression during development, we screened for miRNAs that were associated with muscle development. S-Poly(T) Plus analysis of 273 miRNAs in porcine longissimus dorsi muscles revealed 14 miRNAs that were strongly upregulated with age of postnatal muscle development in vivo, including miR-195 and miR-497. These two miRNAs were also strongly upregulated at late differentiation stages of mouse skeletal myoblast C2C12 cells, and demethylation treatment induced significant upregulation of miR-195/497. Manipulation of miR-195/497 expression resulted in dramatic changes in the proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 cells. We identified high-mobility group AT-hook 1 (Hmga1) mRNA as a highly conserved target of miR-195/497 in C2C12 myoblasts. Overexpression of miR-195/497 or Hmga1 silencing in C2C12 cells promoted myogenic differentiation. Moreover, we showed that miR-195/497 repressed Hmga1, which in turn downregulated one of the HMGA1 downstream targets Id3, whose inhibitory effect on myogenic differentiation is well established. Our study revealed a subset of potential development-associated miRNAs and suggests a novel regulatory axis for myogenesis in which miR-195/497 promote myogenic differentiation by repressing the HMGA1-Id3 pathway.",2017,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics/physiology"", 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/*physiology', 'HMGA Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HMGA1a Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Muscle Development/genetics/*physiology', 'Myoblasts/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Swine']",28255268,hsa-mir-497,yes,"but, no disease"
miR-146a and miR-152 in prostate cancer and clinicopathological parameters.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the expression of miR-146a and miR-152 in the serum of patients with prostate cancer and the relationship between their expression and clinicopathologic parameters. METHODS: 56 patients with prostate cancer and 56 healthy volunteers were included in this study and the relationship between the expression levels of miR-146a and miR-152 and the clinicopathological parameters of the patients with prostate cancer were analyzed. ROC curve was used to search the diagnostic value of each indicator. RESULTS: The expression of miR-146a in patients in the cancer group was significantly higher than that in the normal group (p<0.05). The expression of miR-152 in the cancer group was significantly lower than that in the normal group (p<0.05). The expression level of miR-146a in the patients with prostate cancer was closely related to clinical staging, the presence or absence of bone metastasis, tPSA and pathological staging (p<0.001) and the expression level of miR-152 in the patients with prostate cancer was closely related to clinical staging, the presence or absence of bone metastasis and pathological staging (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The expression level of miR-146a showed a trend of up-regulation in prostate cancer, and the expression level of miR-152 had a trend of down-regulation in prostate cancer, and the results of partial correlation analysis showed that the expression level of miR-146a and miR-152 was negatively correlated with each other in the serum of the patients with prostate cancer.",2019,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/secondary', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']",31646827,hsa-mir-146a,no,

MicroRNA-155 inhibits dengue virus replication by inducing heme,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to directly alter the virus life cycle and virus-host interactions, and so are considered promising molecules for controlling virus infection. In the present study, we observed that miR-155 time-dependently downregulated upon dengue virus (DENV) infection. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of miR-155 appeared to limit viral replication in vitro, suggesting that the low levels of miR-155 would be beneficial for DENV replication. In vivo, overexpression of miR-155 protected ICR suckling mice from the life-threatening effects of DENV infection and reduced virus propagation. Further investigation revealed that the anti-DENV activity of miR-155 was due to target Bach1, resulting in the induction of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-mediated inhibition of DENV NS2B/NS3 protease activity, ultimately leading to induction of antiviral interferon responses, including interferon-induced protein kinase R (PKR), 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS2, and OAS3 expression, against DENV replication. Collectively, our results provide a promising new strategy to manage DENV infection by modulation of miR-155 expression.",2020,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'Dengue/*drug therapy/*genetics/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*drug effects', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",32277848,hsa-mir-155,yes,"bur, protective"
Coordinated targeting of MMP-2/MMP-9 by miR-296-3p/FOXCUT exerts,"Choroidal melanoma is the most common intraocular tumor in adults, and overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 or matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-2/MMP-9) is associated with angiogenesis and tumor metastasis of the choroidal malignant melanoma (CMM). This study aims to investigate the functions and mechanisms of microRNA or long non-coding RNA-targeted MMP-2/MMP-9 in CMM. We demonstrated that expressions of MMP-2/MMP-9 were increased in CMM tissues and C918 cells in comparison with normal choroidal melanocytes. Bio-informatics prediction and our experiments validated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 were simultaneously targeted by miR-296-3p and FOXC1 promoter upstream transcript (FOXCUT); the latter two exerted tumor-suppressing effects on CMM cells by inhibiting cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, invasion, and induction of cell apoptosis. Furthermore, significant downregulations of miR-296-3p and FOXCUT were found in C918 cells compared with choroidal melanocytes from the unaffected eyes, and a positive correlation was observed between their levels in three cases of eye malignant melanomas. Our data indicated that MMP-2/MMP-9 was coordinately targeted by two non-coding RNAs, miR-296-3p and FOXCUT, which were decreased, and tumor-suppressing factors in CMM.

Lung epithelial cells resist influenza A infection by inducing the expression of cytochrome c oxidase VIc which is modulated by miRNA 4276.,"Influenza virus infection induces several changes in host miRNA profile, host cell death and tissue damage. Cytochrome c is a regulator of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is altered during viral infections. Within the first 3h of infection with influenza virus, significant down-regulation of hsa-miRNA-4276 (miRNA-4276) is followed by a 2-fold increase in cytochrome c oxidase VIC (COX6C) mRNA was found to occur in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Expression of caspase-9 also increased within the first 3h of infection, but subsequently decreased. Modulation of miR-4276 using mimic and inhibitor oligonucleotides showed significant down-regulation or up-regulation, respectively, of COX6C expression. Our data suggests that on initial exposure to influenza virus, host cells upregulate COX6C mRNA expression through silencing miR-4276 and repressed viral replication by inducing the apoptotic protein caspase-9. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-4276 may be an important regulator of the early stages of infection by influenza.",2014 Nov,"['Animals', 'Bronchi/*cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/immunology/*virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/physiology', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/*physiology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Respiratory Mucosa/*cytology']",25203353,hsa-mir-4276,yes,
Helicobacter pylori infection modulates the expression of miRNAs associated with,"Genetic and epigenetic inactivation of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes might lead to modifications in cancer-related gene expression and cancer development. Recently, it has been shown that the infection by Helicobacter pylori, the major causative agent of gastric cancer, induces DNA damage and inhibits MMR DNA repair. Also, it has been reported that microRNAs (miRs) have an important role in regulating genomic stability and MMR DNA repair. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify miRs regulating MMR pathway in H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis. To address this question, a gastric epithelial cell line and AGS cancer gastric cells were infected with several H. pylori strains. MMR gene expression and miRs correlating with H. pylori strain infection were evaluated. The results showed that H. pylori infection significantly down-regulated the expression of all selected MMR genes. Also, H. pylori infection modulated the expression of several miRs (including miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-3163), after 4, 8, and 12 h of infection. Computational prediction of candidate miRs and their predicted MMR targeting sites were obtained from TargetScan, mirDB, and MetaCore. The generated data indicated that the selected miRs (miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-3163) could possibly target and modulate MMR genes (POLD3, MSH2, and MSH3, respectively). The target validation was performed using mimics and luciferase gene reporter assays. Briefly, this study shows that H. pylori impairs MMR DNA repair pathway and identifies miRs that regulate MMR gene expression in gastric cancer. ?? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Mismatch Repair', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Helicobacter Infections/*complications/*genetics/microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/*physiology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Stomach/*microbiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/*microbiology']",27862371,hsa-mir-150,no,
Identification of candidate microRNA biomarkers in diabetic nephropathy: a,"AIMS: The aim was to perform a meta-analysis on the miRNA expression profiling studies in diabetic nephropathy (DN) to identify candidate diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was done in several databases and 53 DN miRNA expression studies were selected. To identify significant DN-miR meta-signatures, two meta-analysis methods were employed: vote-counting strategy and the robust rank aggregation method. The targets of DN-miRs were obtained and a gene set enrichment analysis was carried out to identify the pathways most strongly affected by dysregulation of these miRNAs. RESULTS: We identified a significant miRNA meta-signature common to both meta-analysis approaches of three up-regulated (miR-21-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-10a-5p) and two down-regulated (miR-25-3p and miR-26a-5p) miRNAs. Besides that, subgroup analyses divided and compared the differentially expressed miRNAs according to species (human and animal), types of diabetes (T1DN and T2DN) and tissue types (kidney, blood and urine). Enrichment analysis confirmed that DN-miRs supportively target functionally related genes in signaling and community pathways in DN. CONCLUSION: Five highly significant and consistently dysregulated miRNAs were identified, and future studies should focus on discovering their potential effect on DN and their clinical value as DN biomarkers and therapeutic mediators.",2018,"['Diabetic Nephropathies/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcriptome']",30019103,hsa-mir-21,no,
Quantitative Prediction of Steatosis in Patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease worldwide, but a reliable non-invasive method to quantify liver steatosis in primary healthcare is not available. Circulating microRNAs have been proposed as biomarkers of severe/advanced NAFLD (steatohepatitis and fibrosis). However, the use of circulating miRNAs to quantitatively assess the % of liver fat in suspected NAFLD patients has not been investigated. We performed global miRNA sequencing in two sets of samples: human livers from organ donors (n = 20), and human sera from biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (n = 23), both with a wide range of steatosis quantified in their liver biopsies. Partial least squares (PLS) regression combined with recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select miRNAs associated with steatosis. Moreover, regression models with only 2 or 3 miRNAs, with high biological relevance, were built. Comprehensive microRNA sequencing of liver and serum samples resulted in two sets of abundantly expressed miRNAs (418 in liver and 351 in serum). Pearson correlation analyses indicated that 18% of miRNAs in liver and 14.5% in serum were significantly associated with the amount of liver fat. PLS-RFE models demonstrated that 50 was the number of miRNAs providing the lowest error in both liver and serum models predicting steatosis. Comparison of the two miRNA subsets showed 19 coincident miRNAs that were ranked according to biological significance (guide/passenger strand, relative abundance in liver and serum, number of predicted lipid metabolism target genes, correlation significance, etc.). Among them, miR-10a-5p, miR-98-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-30e-5p, miR-32-5p and miR-145-5p showed the highest biological relevance. PLS regression models with serum levels of 2-3 of these miRNAs predicted the % of liver fat with errors &lt;5%.",2022,"['*Circulating MicroRNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', '*MicroRNAs/metabolism', '*Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/metabolism']",36012565,hsa-mir-30e,no,
A capillary electrophoresis method for identifying forensically relevant body,"Body fluid identification (BFID) can provide crucial information during the course of an investigation. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have shown considerable body fluid specificity, are able to be co-extracted with DNA, and their small size (18-25 nucleotides) make them ideal for analyzing highly degraded forensic samples. In this study, we designed a preliminary 8-marker system for BFID including an endogenous reference gene (let-7g) to differentiate between venous blood (miR-451a and miR-142-3p), menstrual blood (miR-141-3p and miR-412-3p), semen (miR-891a and miR-10b), and saliva (miR-205) using a capillary electrophoresis approach. This panel uses a linear primer system in order to incorporate additional miRNA markers by forming a multiplex system. The miRNA system was able to distinguish between venous blood, menstrual blood, semen, and saliva using a rudimentary data interpretation strategy.

MiR-21 up-regulation in ampullary adenocarcinoma and its pre-invasive lesions.,"Poor information is available on the molecular landscape characterizing the carcinogenetic process leading to ampullary carcinoma. MiR-21 is one of the most frequently up-regulated miRNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a tumor sharing similar molecular features with ampullary adenocarcinomas (AVCs), above all with the pancreatic-biliary type. We profiled, by in situ hybridization (ISH), miR-21 expression in a series of 26 AVCs, 50 ampullary dysplastic lesions (35 low-grade [LG-IEN] and 15 high-grade [HG-IEN]) and 10 normal duodenal mucosa samples. The same series was investigated by immunohistochemistry for ?э-catenin, p53 and HER2 expression. HER2 gene amplification was evaluated by chromogenic in situ hybridization. To validate miR-21 ISH results we performed miR-21 qRT-PCR analysis in a series of 10 AVCs and their matched normal samples. All the normal control samples showed a negative or faint miR-21 expression, whereas a significant miR-21 up-regulation was observed during the carcinogenetic cascade (p < 0.001), with 21/26 (80.8%) of cancer samples showing a miR-21 overexpression. In comparison to control samples, a significant overexpression was found in samples of LG-IEN (p = .0003), HG-IEN (p = .0001), and AVCs (p < 0.0001). No significant difference in miR-21 overexpression was observed between LG-IEN, HG-IEN and AVCs. By qRT-PCR analysis, AVCs showed a 1.7-fold increase over the controls (p = .003). P53 was frequently dysregulated in both dysplastic and carcinoma samples (44 out of 76; 57.9%). A 20% (10/50) of dysplastic lesions and 11% (3/26) of carcinomas were characterized by a nuclear localization of ?э-catenin. Only 2 AVCs (7.7%; both intestinal-type) showed a HER2 overexpression (both 2+), which corresponded to a HER2 gene amplification at CISH analysis. This is the first study demonstrating a miRNA dysregulation in the whole spectrum of ampullary carcinogenesis.

Interactions between microRNA-200 family and Sestrin proteins in endometrial,"In the present study, we intend to determine whether Sestrin proteins 1, 2, and 3 (SESN1-3) are targets of microRNA-200 family (miR-200) in endometrial cancer (EC) Ishikawa, AN3CA, KLE, and RL 95-2 cell lines and to investigate how these potential interactions influence anoikis resistance of EC cell lines. The luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and western blotting assays were used to verify whether SESN1-3 are direct targets of miR-200. Moreover, the anoikis assay and transient transfections of miR-200 mimics or inhibitors into EC cell lines were performed to evaluate the modulatory role of miR-200 and SESN proteins on anoikis resistance. We demonstrated that SESN2 protein is a direct target of mir-141 in KLE and RL-95-2 EC cell lines and the functional interaction of miR-141 and SESN2 protein has a downstream effect on anoikis resistance and SESN2 expression level in Ishikawa and AN3CA cell lines. Moreover, we have shown that SESN3 protein is a direct target of miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-429 in Ishikawa, AN3CA, and KLE cell lines. Our results show that manipulation of miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-429 expression patterns also has an influence on anoikis resistance in EC cell lines.

"Identification of miR-130a, miR-27b and miR-210 as serum biomarkers for","BACKGROUND: Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) is a kind of peripheral arterial disease. Most patients with ASO have no apparent clinical symptoms early on, but a diagnosis at the early stage is essential to prevent progression. Unfortunately, the specific and sensitive markers for ASO are still lacking currently. In this study, using both tissue samples and blood samples obtained from ASO patients, we aim to find a cluster of miRNAs that can be used as new risk-markers for the diagnosis of ASO in the earlier stages. METHODS: We enrolled 104 patients diagnosed with ASO and 105 age-matched controls. We examined the expression levels of a series of miRNAs in both intima samples and serum samples from these patients. RESULTS: Levels of miR-21, miR-130a, miR-27b, let-7f and miR-210 significantly increased, while levels of miR-221 and miR-222 significantly decreased in the sclerotic samples compared with normal samples. Significant increase of miR-130a, miR-27b and miR-210 expression was observed in the serum samples of ASO patients. Moreover, the expression of miR-130a and miR-27b in sera of ASO patients was positively correlated with Fontaine stages.

Identification of serum microRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for acute pancreatitis.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To identify serum microRNA (miRNA) as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for acute pancreatitis (AP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sera microRNA expression was profiled from 12 AP patients with varying disease severity and three healthy controls. Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated in a larger cohort of patients and controls. The diagnostic and prognostic potentials of differentially expressed miRNAs were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and compared to that of classic prognostic markers for AP. RESULTS: miRNA microarray analyses identified 205 differentially expressed miRNAs between sera from AP patients and that from controls. Nine miRNAs were differentially expressed between severe and mild AP patients. Further validation confirmed the down-regulation of miR-92b, miR-10a, and miR-7 in AP patients, and ROC analysis revealed that these miRNAs can differentiate AP from health cases. Furthermore, the serum miR-551b-5p level was significantly higher in patients with disease complications or a low plasma calcium level. ROC analysis showed that the serum miR-551b-5p level can distinguish between severe and mild AP.

Genome-wide pharmacologic unmasking identifies tumor suppressive microRNAs in multiple myeloma.,"Epigenetic alterations have emerged as an important cause of microRNA (miRNA) deregulation. In Multiple Myeloma (MM), a few tumor suppressive miRNAs silenced by DNA hypermethylation have been reported, but so far there are few systemic investigations on epigenetically silenced miRNAs. We conducted genome-wide screening for tumor suppressive miRNAs epigenetically silenced in MM. Four Human MM Cell lines were treated with demethylating agent 5'azacytidine (5'aza). Consistently upregulated miRNAs include miR-155, miR-198, miR-135a*, miR-200c, miR-125a-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-483-5p, miR-663, and miR-630. Methylation array analysis revealed increased methylation at or near miRNA-associated CpG islands in MM patients.

MicroRNA-dependent regulation of PTEN after arsenic trioxide treatment in bladder,"Arsenic trioxide has shown remarkable biological activity against bladder cancer in some clinical studies. However, the mechanism of its action is unknown. Our aim was to find the relationship between miRNAs and arsenic trioxide treatment by using T24 human bladder carcinoma cells. By performing microRNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR after ATO treatment, we found that expression levels of several miRNAs, in particular, miRNA-19a, were significantly decreased in T24 cell line. Furthermore, cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry analysis, prediction of miRNA targets, Western blot analysis, and luciferase reporter assay were performed to determine the role of mir-19a in affecting the biological behaviors of T24 cells. Several miRNAs were up-regulated or down-regulated in T24 cells treated with arsenic trioxide compared to their controls. If only changes above two folds were considered, two miRNAs were identified, miRNA-19a was down-regulated, while miRNA-222* was up-regulated. Among them, knockdown of miRNA-19a by anti-miRNA-19a transfection showed a positive therapeutic effect in bladder cancer cells by inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell apoptosis targeting PTEN through the PTEN/Akt pathway. Besides this, a synergy effect was detected between knockdown of miRNA-19a and arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide altered miRNA expression profile in T24 cells. It seems miRNA-19a plays a critical role in the mechanism of arsenic trioxide treatment in bladder cancer. The synergy effect between miRNA-19a and arsenic trioxide that advocates targeting the mir-19a may represent a potential approach to enhance the efficacy and safety of ATO to treat bladder cancer by a decrease in dose.",2011,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology']",20857258,hsa-mir-19a,yes,
"Role of microRNAs in vascular diseases, inflammation, and angiogenesis.","The integrity of the endothelial monolayer is fundamental for the homoeostasis of the vascular system. Functional endothelial cells are also required for the growth of new blood vessels during neovascularization. Although multiple growth factors have been shown to regulate angiogenesis and vascular development, little is known about the complex upstream regulation of gene expression and translation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an emerging class of highly conserved, non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression on the post-transcriptional level by inhibiting the translation of protein from mRNA or by promoting the degradation of mRNA. More than 500 human miRNAs have been identified so far, and increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs have distinct expression profiles and play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes such as cardiogenesis, haematopoietic lineage differentiation, and oncogenesis. Meanwhile, a few specific miRNAs that regulate endothelial cell functions and angiogenesis have been described. Let7-f, miR-27b, and mir-130a were identified as pro-angiogenic miRNAs. In contrast, miR-221 and miR-222 inhibit endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis in vitro by targeting the stem cell factor receptor c-kit and indirectly regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. Moreover, some miRNAs are involved in tumour angiogenesis such as the miR-17-92 cluster and miR-378. Early studies also indicate the contribution of specific miRNAs (e.g. miR-155, miR-21, and miR-126) to vascular inflammation and diseases. Thus, the identification of miRNAs and their respective targets may offer new therapeutic strategies to treat vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, to improve neovascularization after ischaemia, or to prevent tumour progression.",2008,"['Animals', 'Endothelium, Vascular/enzymology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*genetics/physiopathology/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Ribonuclease III/metabolism', 'Vascular Diseases/*genetics/physiopathology/therapy']",18550634,hsa-mir-27b,no,

Circulating microRNAs correlate to clinical parameters in individuals with,"BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic airway disease affecting millions of people. Better methods to define asthma subgroups using clinical parameters and molecular biomarkers are crucial in the development of personalized medicine. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) may be used to distinguish well-defined asthma groups. METHODS: Blood serum from 116 well-defined subjects, including healthy controls and individuals with allergic or non-allergic asthma, from the West Sweden Asthma Study were included. Serum was analyzed for circulating miRNA expression of miR-126, - 145, -146a, - 155, - 223, and -374a and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Correlations between clinical characteristics and circulating miRNA expression as well as potential miRNA gene targets were investigated. RESULTS: A subset of miRNAs were differentially expressed between allergic and non-allergic asthmatic individuals. Alterations in expression of miR-155, -146a, -374a and - 145 were observed in allergic asthmatics in response to inhaled corticosteroid usage. Additionally, miR-223 and miR-374a expression varied in non-allergic asthmatics based on blood eosinophil numbers. Numerous clinical parameters, including lung function measurements, correlated with subsets of miRNAs. Finally, pathway analysis revealed a potential role for inhaled corticosteroid induced miRNAs in leukocyte regulation, IL-6 signaling and glucocorticoid response. CONCLUSION: Circulating miRNA expression was altered in subjects with allergic and non-allergic asthma and correlated to clinical parameters including lung function and potential gene targets involved in immune processes. This combination of clinical and molecular data may be a basis for the further, more precise classification of asthma subgroups.

MALAT1 knockdown promoted cell viability and migration of LPS-treated MG-63 cells via sponging miR-212.,"BACKGROUND: Most fractures could heal after treatment, around 5-10 % of patients still develop delayed union and nonunion. Evidence has increasingly shown that abnormal expression of long noncoding RNAs is closely related to the occurrence and development of various diseases including fracture healing. However, evidence regarding the effect of MALAT1 on fracture healing remains limited. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we attempt to explore the role of MALAT1 during the process of femoral neck fracture healing and elucidate the underlying mechanism of this disease. METHODS: We first detect the expression of lncRNAs in serums from 3 pairs of patients with delayed femoral neck fracture healing and healthy volunteers using lncRNA microarray. And the expression of long noncoding RNA MALAT1 in serums and LPS-treated MG-63 cells was measured using qRT-PCR. CCK-8 assay, cell migration and qRT-PCR were applied to the role of MALAT1 knockdown in LPS-treated MG-63 cells. ELISA was used for the measurement of inflammatory cytokines in serums of patients and healthy volunteers. The bioinformatics analysis and the rescue experiment were devoted to the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: MALAT1 expression was up-regulated in serum of patients with delayed union of femoral neck fracture. MALAT1 knockdown promoted cell viability and migration, reduced inflammation in LPS-treated MG-63 cells. The bioinformatics analysis showed MALAT1 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-212. And SOX6 was a target of miR-212. Besides, MALAT1 knockdown suppressed SOX6 expression via targeting miR-212 in LPS-treated MG-63 cells.

[Screening and expression of CD34(+) cell-specific microRNA in acute myelogenous,"OBJECTIVE: To screen and analyze CD34(+) cell specific microRNAs (miRNAs) from the patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and their expression. METHODS: CD34(+) cells were sorted from AML patients or the mobilized peripheral blood of the donors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (normal control subjects) and followed by the extraction of the cell total RNAs. The differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs, miR) were selected after hybridizing with miRNA microarray, real time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) was subsequently applied to confirm the expression of the selected miRs, and PCR products were further cloned and sequenced to check their specificity. RESULTS: Of the differentially expressed miRNAs, 191 were found to be at least one-fold change in the CD34(+) cells between the AML patients and the normal control subjects. Of the 191 miRNAs, the expression difference of 94 was significant (P < 0.05). Among these 94 miRNAs, the expression of 44 miRNAs was increased and the other 50 miRNAs was decreased in the CD34(+) cells from the bone marrow of AML patients compared with the CD34(+) cells from the mobilized peripheral blood of the normal control subjects. Real time PCR verified that the expression level of miR-10a and miR-220c in the CD34(+) cells from the bone marrow of AML patients was 19.6% and 19.0% of that of CD34(+) cells from mobilized peripheral blood of the normal control subjects. DNA sequencing and BLAST DNA database searching results indicated that the PCR products were really miR-10a and miR-220c.

Alcoholic and Non-Alcoholic Beer Modulate Plasma and Macrophage microRNAs Differently in a Pilot Intervention in Humans with Cardiovascular Risk.,"Beer is a popular beverage and some beneficial effects have been attributed to its moderate consumption. We carried out a pilot study to test if beer and non-alcoholic beer consumption modify the levels of a panel of 53 cardiometabolic microRNAs in plasma and macrophages. Seven non-smoker men aged 30-65 with high cardiovascular risk were recruited for a non-randomised cross-over intervention consisting of the ingestion of 500 mL/day of beer or non-alcoholic beer for 14 days with a 7-day washout period between interventions. Plasma and urine isoxanthohumol were measured to assess compliance with interventions. Monocytes were isolated and differentiated into macrophages, and plasma and macrophage microRNAs were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. Anthropometric, biochemistry and dietary parameters were also measured. We found an increase in plasma miR-155-5p, miR-328-3p, and miR-92a-3p after beer and a decrease after non-alcoholic beer consumption. Plasma miR-320a-3p levels decreased with both beers. Circulating miR-320a-3p levels correlated with LDL-cholesterol. We found that miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-26b-5p, and miR-223-3p macrophage levels increased after beer and decreased after non-alcoholic beer consumption. Functional analyses suggested that modulated microRNAs were involved in catabolism, nutrient sensing, Toll-like receptors signalling and inflammation. We concluded that beer and non-alcoholic beer intake modulated differentially plasma and macrophage microRNAs. Specifically, microRNAs related to inflammation increased after beer consumption and decreased after non-alcoholic beer consumption.",2020 Dec 28,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthropometry', '*Beer', 'Behavior Rating Scale', 'Biomarkers', '*Carbonated Beverages', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cross-Over Studies', '*Heart Disease Risk Factors', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes', 'Pilot Projects', '*Plasma', 'Risk Factors', 'Xanthones/urine']",33379359,hsa-mir-328,no,
Human chromosome 21-derived miRNAs are overexpressed in down syndrome brains and,"Down syndrome (DS), or Trisomy 21, is the most common genetic cause of cognitive impairment and congenital heart defects in the human population. To date, the contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs) in DS has not been investigated. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) harbors five miRNA genes; miR-99a, let-7c, miR-125b-2, miR-155, and miR-802. MiRNA expression profiling, miRNA RT-PCR, and miRNA in situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that these miRNAs are overexpressed in fetal brain and heart specimens from individuals with DS when compared with age- and sex-matched controls. We hypothesize that trisomic 21 gene dosage overexpression of Hsa21-derived miRNAs results in the decreased expression of specific target proteins and contribute, in part, to features of the neuronal and cardiac DS phenotype. Importantly, Hsa21-derived miRNAs may provide novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of individuals with DS.",2008,"['Brain/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Heart', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myocardium/*metabolism']",18387358,hsa-mir-99a,no,
Expression of microRNA-146 in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue.,"OBJECTIVE: Several microRNA, which are approximately 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs, exhibit tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific expression patterns and are associated with human diseases. The objective of this study was to identify the expression pattern of microRNA-146 (miR-146) in synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The expression of miR-146 in synovial tissue from 5 patients with RA, 5 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and 1 normal subject was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry of tissue sections. Induction of miR-146 following stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) of cultures of human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) was examined by quantitative PCR and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Mature miR-146a and primary miR-146a/b were highly expressed in RA synovial tissue, which also expressed TNFalpha, but the 2 microRNA were less highly expressed in OA and normal synovial tissue. In situ hybridization showed primary miR-146a expression in cells of the superficial and sublining layers in synovial tissue from RA patients. Cells positive for miR-146a were primarily CD68+ macrophages, but included several CD3+ T cell subsets and CD79a+ B cells. Expression of miR-146a/b was markedly up-regulated in RASFs after stimulation with TNFalpha and IL-1beta. CONCLUSION: This study shows that miR-146 is expressed in RA synovial tissue and that its expression is induced by stimulation with TNFalpha and IL-1beta.

Withaferin A mediated changes of miRNA expression in breast cancer-derived,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease consisting of atypical cell populations that share stem cell-like characteristics associated with therapeutic resistance, disease relapse, and poor clinical outcome. MicroRNAs (miRNA), and small noncoding RNA, are pivotal in the regulation of self-renewal, stemness, and cellular differentiation. Withaferin A (WA), a steroidal lactone, is a major bioactive constituent of Withania somnifera (Solanaceae) known for its anticancer properties. In this study, the effect of WA on modulation of miRNA expression in breast cancer-derived mammosphere was assessed utilizing small RNA sequencing. Treatment with WA inhibited MCF-7 and T47D cells derived mammosphere formation with a significant decrease in CD44, EpCAM, Nanog, OCT4, and SOX2 as markers of self-renewal and stemness. Small RNA sequencing demonstrated a total of 395 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) including 194 upregulated and 201 downregulated miRNAs in WA-treated MCF-7 mammospheres. Bioinformatics analysis utilizing the KEGG pathway, Gene Ontology enrichment, protein-protein, and miRNA-mRNA interaction network identified altered expression in a few hub genes viz. AKT1, PTEN, MYC, CCND1, VEGFA, NOTCH1, and IGFR1 associated with DEMs in WA-treated mammospheres. Further quantitative RT-PCR analysis validated the expression of DEMs including miR-549a-5p, miR-1247-5p, miR-124-5p, miR-137-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-99a-5p, miR-181a-5p, let-7c-5p, and let-7a-5p. In particular, let-7c-5p is designated as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. An increase in miR-let-7c-5p expression was noted after WA treatment, with a simultaneous decrease in CCND1 and c-MYC at mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, our study demonstrated WA-mediated miRNA expression, in particular, upregulation of miR-let-7c-5p, leads to the inhibition of breast cancer cells derived mammospheres.",2022,"['*Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Withanolides']",35770722,hsa-mir-99a,no,
"Curcumin-Attenuated TREM-1/DAP12/NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL1B, TLR4/NF-?§B Pathways, and","We aimed to evaluate the effects of 1,2-diacetylbenzene (DAB) and curcumin on neuroinflammation induced by DAB via triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLP3)/calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 1 (CAPS1)/interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) pathways; tau hyperphosphorylation; reactive oxygen species (ROS); and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) in microglia cells; and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the key genes induced by DAB and targeted by curcumin in silico analysis. In this study, Western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunocytochemistry were used as the key methods in vitro. In silico analysis, GeneMANIA, ToppFun feature, Metascape, CHEA3, Cytoscape, Autodock, and MIENTURNET were the core approaches used. Curcumin inhibited both the DAB-induced TREM-1/DAP12/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL1B pathway and the TLR4/NF-?§B pathway. In BV2 cells, curcumin inhibited ROS, AGE, hyperphosphorylation, glycogen synthase kinase-3?э (GSK-3?э), and ?э-amyloid while activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression.

LncRNA DANCR promotes ATG7 expression to accelerate hepatocellular carcinoma cell,"OBJECTIVE: LncRNA differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA (DANCR) is an oncogene in various malignant cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Autophagy is an intracellular self-digestion mechanism that accelerates the progression of HCC via promoting cell survival. However, the role of lncRNA DANCR in HCC, and the mechanism of lncRNA DANCR in the regulation of autophagy in HCC remains unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study are the investigation of the role of lncRNA DANCR in HCC, and the exploration of the molecular mechanism of lncRNA DANCR in regulating autophagy of HCC cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, the expression of lncRNA DANCR, miR-222-3p, and autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) was detected by qRT-PCR. The cell proliferation and colony formation were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assay. And the autophagic flux was evaluated by mRFP-GFP-LC3B reporter. The autophagy related proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Besides, the relationship between lncRNA DANCR and miR-222-3p, as well as between miR-222-3p and ATG7, was determined by Dual-Luciferase reporter system. RESULTS: We found high expression of lncRNA DANCR and ATG7, and low expression of miR-222-3p in HCC tissues and cell lines. And lncRNA DANCR positively correlated with poor survival of HCC patients. Moreover, the knockdown of lncRNA DANCR inhibited cell proliferation and autophagy of HCC cells. And we predicted and proved that lncRNA DANCR induced cell proliferation, colony formation and autophagy by increasing ATG7 and suppressing miR-222-3p.

RESULTS: A total of 3 miRNAs (miR-125a-5p, miR-25, and miR-126) were selected for further analysis in this study. The combination of the 3 miRNAs could produce 0.936 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value in distinguishing early stage lung cancer patients from control subjects with 87.5% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity, respectively.

Regulation of 11?э-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 by microRNA.,"The enzyme 11?э-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11?э-HSD2) is selectively expressed in aldosterone target tissues, conferring aldosterone selectivity for the mineralocorticoid receptor. A diminished activity causes salt-sensitive hypertension. The mechanism of the variable and distinct 11?э-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 gene (HSD11B2) expression in the cortical collecting duct is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed for the first time whether the 11?э-HSD2 expression is modulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). In silico analysis revealed 53 and 27 miRNAs with potential binding sites on human or rat HSD11B2 3'-untranslated region. A reporter assay demonstrated 3'-untranslated region-dependent regulation of human and rodent HSD11B2. miRNAs were profiled from cortical collecting ducts and proximal convoluted tubules. Bioinformatic analyses showed a distinct clustering for cortical collecting ducts and proximal convoluted tubules with 53 of 375 miRNAs, where 13 were predicted to bind to the rat HSD11B2 3'-untranslated region. To gain insight into potentially relevant miRNAs in vivo, we investigated 2 models with differential 11?э-HSD2 activity linked with salt-sensitive hypertension. (1) Comparing Sprague-Dawley with low and Wistar rats with high 11?э-HSD2 activity revealed rno-miR-20a-5p, rno-miR-19b-3p, and rno-miR-190a-5p to be differentially expressed. (2) Uninephrectomy lowered 11?э-HSD2 activity in the residual kidney with differentially expressed rno-miR-19b-3p, rno-miR-29b-3p, and rno-miR-26-5p.

MiRNA-130a promotes inflammation to accelerate atherosclerosis via the regulation,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the possible function of miR-130a in atherosclerosis (AS), protection against AS, and its molecular biological mechanism. METHODS: Apoe-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet as the AS mice model. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used as in vitro model. Serum samples or cells were used to measure the expression of inflammation. Serum samples or cells were used to determine MiRNA expression profiles using the edgeR tool from Bioconductor. Western Blot analysis was used to assess protein expressions of proliferator-activated receptor ?? (PPAR??) and nuclear factor (NF)-?§B. RESULTS: MiRNA-130a expression was up-regulated in atherosclerotic mice. In addition, over-expression of miRNA-130a promoted inflammation factors [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?с and interleukin (IL)-1?э, IL-6, and IL-8] in the in vitro model of AS. However, down-regulation of miRNA-130a reduced inflammation (suppressed TNF-?с, IL-1?э, IL-6 and IL-8) in the in vitro model. Furthermore, over-expression of miRNA-130a could also suppress the protein expression of PPAR?? and induce NF-?§B protein expression in the in vitro model. However, suppression of miRNA-130a induced the protein expression of PPAR?? and suppressed NF-?§B protein expression in the in vitro model of AS.

Long noncoding RNA NR2F1-AS1 promotes the malignancy of non-small cell lung cancer via sponging microRNA-493-5p and thereby increasing ITGB1 expression.,"Several studies have reported that the long noncoding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) NR2F1 antisense RNA 1 (NR2F1-AS1) affects multiple cellular pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. The present study aimed to detect NR2F1-AS1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), investigate the role of NR2F1-AS1 in promoting the tumorigenic behavior of NSCLC cells, and elucidate the mechanism underlying the effect of NR2F1-AS1 on NSCLC progression. Our results showed that NR2F1-AS1 expression was upregulated in NSCLC cells, and notably, its upregulation was correlated with adverse clinical characteristics and shorter overall survival in patients with NSCLC. The absence of NR2F1-AS1 functionally decreased NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoted tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, the tumor growth of NSCLC cells in vivo was inhibited after NR2F1-AS1 silencing. Mechanistically, NR2F1-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-493-5p and consequently increased ITGB1 expression. Rescue assays further validated that an increased output of the miR-493-5p/ITGB1 axis could neutralize the regulatory impact of NR2F1-AS1 knockdown on the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells. In summary, the NR2F1-AS1/miR-493-5p/ITGB1 pathway initiates pro-oncogenic behavior in NSCLC tumor progression, and the NR2F1-AS1/miR-493-5p/ITGB1 axis may provide new molecular targets for anticancer therapy against NSCLC.",2020 Aug 7,"['Aged', 'COUP Transcription Factor I/*genetics', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",32784268,hsa-mir-493,yes,
"Immunomodulatory effects of phytosomal curcumin on related-micro RNAs, CD200","Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) have significant potential of immunomodulatory for therapeutic and regenerative biomedical applications compared to other mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Nowadays, alteration of gene expression is an important way to improve the performance of MSCs in the clinic. MicroRNAs (miRs) and CD200 are known to modulate the immune system in MSCs. Curcumin is famous for its anti-inflammatory impacts. Phytosomal curcumin (PC) is a nanoparticle synthesized from curcumin that removes the drawbacks of curcumin. The purpose of this research was to assess the effects of PC on the expression of the CD200 and four key miRNAs in immune system. PC (30 ?¬M) treatment of hDPSCs could ameliorate their immunoregulatory property, presented by reduced expressions of miR-21, miR-155 and miR-126, as well as enhanced expressions of miR-23 and CD200. The PC was also able to reduce PI3K\AKT1\NF-?§B expressions that were target genes for these miRs and involved in inflammatory pathways. Moreover, PC was more effective than curcumin in improving the immune modulation of hDPSCs. Evidence in this study suggested that PC mediates immunoregulatory activities in hDPSC via miRs and CD200 to regulate PI3K\AKT1\NF-?§B signalling pathways, which may provide a theoretical basis for PC in the treatment of many diseases. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Autoimmune diseases or tooth caries are partly attributed to global health problems and their common drug treatments have several side effects. The goal of this study is dentin regeneration and autoimmune diseases treatment via stem cell-based approaches with phytosomal curcumin (PC), for the first time. Because dental pulp stem cells have unique advantages (including higher immunomodulatory capacity) over other mesenchymal stem cells, we considered them the best option for treating these diseases. Using PC, we try to increase the immunomodulatory properties of these cells.",2021,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Curcumin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dental Pulp/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy/immunology', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology']",34235754,hsa-mir-126,no,
Overexpression of long non-coding RNA TUG1 alleviates TNF-?с-induced inflammatory,"OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder in the gastrointestinal tract. Inflammatory response has been found to participate in the pathogenesis of IBS. This study aimed to explore the effects of long non-coding RNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?с)-induced interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) inflammatory injury, which was relevant to the pathogenesis of IBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of TUG1 and microRNA-127 (miR-127) were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Viability, apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-associated factors were analyzed by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and Western blot, respectively. The mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Finally, activations of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-?§B) and Notch pathways were evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: TNF-?с treatment inhibited ICC viability, induced ICC apoptosis and promoted an inflammatory response in ICC. TUG1 was downregulated in TNF-?с-treated ICC. TUG1 overexpression protected ICC from TNF-?с-induced apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. TUG1 suppression showed opposite effects. MiR-127 was negatively regulated by TUG1 and implicated in the action of TUG1 in ICC. MiR-127 up-regulation largely reversed the effects of TUG1 on TNF-?с-treated ICC. Mechanistically, TUG1 inhibited TNF-?с-induced activation of NF-?§B and Notch pathways in ICC by down-regulating miR-127. CONCLUSIONS: TUG1 attenuated TNF-?с-caused apoptosis and inflammatory response in ICC by down-regulating miR-127 and then inactivating NF-?§B and Notch pathways.",2019,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interstitial Cells of Cajal/*immunology/pathology', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",30657572,hsa-mir-127,no,
Control of EVI-1 oncogene expression in metastatic breast cancer cells through,"Metastasis in breast cancer carries a disproportionately worse prognosis than localized primary disease. To identify microRNAs (miRNA) involved in metastasis, the expression of 254 miRNAs was measured across the following cell lines using microarray analysis: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, cells that grew as a tumor in the mammary fat pad of nude mice (TMD-231), metastatic disease to the lungs (LMD-231), bone (BMD-231) and adrenal gland (ADMD-231). A brain-seeking variant of this cell line (231-BR) was used additionally in validation studies. Twenty miRNAs were upregulated and seven were downregulated in metastatic cancer cells compared with TMD-231 cells. The expression of the tumor suppressor miRNAs let-7 and miR-22 was consistently downregulated in metastatic cancer cells. These metastatic cells expressed higher levels of putative/proven miR-22 target oncogenes ERBB3, CDC25C and EVI-1. Introduction of miR-22 into cancer cells reduced the levels of ERBB3 and EVI-1 as well as phospho-AKT, an EVI-1 downstream target. The miR-22 primary transcript is located in the 5'-untranslated region of an open reading frame C17orf91, and the promoter/enhancer of C17orf91 drives miR-22 expression. We observed elevated C17orf91 expression in non-basal subtype compared with basal subtype breast cancers. In contrast, elevated expression of EVI-1 was observed in basal subtype and was associated with poor outcome in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients. These results suggest that metastatic cancer cells increase specific oncogenic signaling proteins through downregulation of miRNAs. Identifying such metastasis-specific oncogenic pathways may help to manipulate tumor behavior and aid in the design of more effective targeted therapies.",2011,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",21057539,hsa-mir-22,no,
Expression of the miR-148/152 Family in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and its Clinical,"BACKGROUND MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the development and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The miR-148/152 family has been reported to be express differently in various kinds of tumors. We investigated the expression level of the miR-148/152 family in AML patients and their clinical significance. MATERIAL AND METHODS Expression levels of the miR-148/152 family in 80 patients with newly diagnosed AML and 20 healthy participants were analyzed by qRT-PCR. We also evaluated the relationship between the expression levels of the miR-148/152 family and clinicopathological features of AML patients. RESULTS Compared with healthy controls, we found a significant lower expression of downregulated miR-148/152 in AML patients (p<0.0001). The expression of miR148/152 family was associated with various AML clinicopathological risk parameters including FAB classifications, cytogenetics, and gene mutations. The number of patients with high expression levels of miR-148a/b was significantly increased in the low-risk group and significantly decreased in the high-risk group. (p=0.025, p=0.000, respectively). Patients with higher expression of miR-148b showed a higher complete remission (CR) rate (p=0.043). Importantly, higher expression of miR-148a/b was correlated with lower relapse rate (p=0.035, p=0.027, respectively) and showed a longer relapse-free survival (RFS) (p=0.0321, p=0.002, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, RFS was significantly affected by the expression of miR-148a/b in patients the high and the intermediate-risk groups (p=0.0499, p=0.0114, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The expression levels of the miR-148/152 family were lower in patients with AML compared to healthy controls, and were associated with various AML clinicopathological parameters and therapeutic effect.

Circulating microRNAs in Huntington's disease: Emerging mediators in metabolic impairment.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease, with peripheral consequences that negatively contribute to quality of life. Circulating microRNAs (cmiRNAs) are being explored for their roles in intercellular communication and gene expression regulation, which allows gaining insight into the regulation of crosstalk between neuronal and peripheral tissues. Here, we explore the cmiRNA profile of plasma samples from fifteen symptomatic patients, with 40-45 CAG repeats in the HTT gene, and seven healthy matched controls. Isolated miRNAs from plasma samples were run against human miRNome panels, which have sequences for 752 human mature miRNAs. We found that 168 cmiRNAs are altered in symptomatic patients. Considering Bonferroni's correction, miR-877-5p, miR-223-3p, miR-223-5p, miR-30d-5p, miR-128, miR-22-5p, miR-222-3p, miR-338-3p, miR-130b-3p, miR-425-5p, miR-628-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-942 are significantly increased in HD patients as compared with controls. Moreover, after patient's organization according to approved HD scales, miR-122-5p is significantly decreased in HD patients with Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale >24, whereas an increase in miR-100-5p levels and a decrease in miR-641 and miR-330-3p levels were recorded when patients were rearranged by Total Functional Capacity. These results suggest that cmiRNA profile could be further modified by disease progression, making cmiRNAs useful as monitoring biomarkers. Analysis of target genes indicated a general overexpression of cmiRNAs implicated in metabolism regulation. Profiling cmiRNA of HD subjects opens the possibility of personalized therapies for different groups of HD patients, based on disease modifiers: regulation of altered pathways might contribute to not only alleviate disease symptoms, but also influence HD progression.",2016 Jun,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood/metabolism', 'Circulating MicroRNA/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Huntington Disease/blood/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life']",27155059,hsa-mir-361,no,
HNRNPA2/B1 is upregulated in endocrine-resistant LCC9 breast cancer cells and alters the miRNA transcriptome when overexpressed in MCF-7 cells.,"MicroRNAs are dysregulated in breast cancer. Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2/B1) is a reader of the N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) mark in primary-miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) and promotes DROSHA processing to precursor-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). We examined the expression of writers, readers, and erasers of m6A and report that HNRNPA2/B1 expression is higher in tamoxifen-resistant LCC9 breast cancer cells as compared to parental, tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 cells. To examine how increased expression of HNRNPA2/B1 affects miRNA expression, HNRNPA2/B1 was transiently overexpressed (~5.4-fold) in MCF-7 cells for whole genome miRNA profiling (miRNA-seq). 148 and 88 miRNAs were up- and down-regulated, respectively, 48 h after transfection and 177 and 172 up- and down-regulated, respectively, 72 h after transfection. MetaCore Enrichment analysis identified progesterone receptor action and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling via miRNA in breast cancer as pathways downstream of the upregulated miRNAs and TGFbeta signaling via SMADs and Notch signaling as pathways of the downregulated miRNAs. GO biological processes for mRNA targets of HNRNPA2/B1-regulated miRNAs included response to estradiol and cell-substrate adhesion. qPCR confirmed HNRNPA2B1 downregulation of miR-29a-3p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-222 and upregulation of miR-1266-5p, miR-1268a, miR-671-3p.

"Changes in miR-222 expression, DNA repair capacity, and MDM2-p53 axis in","Mechanisms for hematotoxicity and health effects from exposure to low doses of benzene (BZ) remain to be identified. To address the information gap, our investigation was focused onto using appropriate populations and cell cultures to investigate novel BZ-induced effects such as disruption of DNA repair capacity (DRC). From our study, abnormal miRNAs were identified and validated using lymphocytes from 56 BZ-poisoned workers and 53 controls. In addition, 173 current BZ-exposed workers and 58 controls were investigated for key miRNA expression using RT-PCR and for cellular DRC using a challenge assay. Subsequently, the observed activities in lymphocytes were verified using human HL-60 (p53 null) and TK6 (p53 wild-type) cells via 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ) treatment and miR-222 interferences. The targeting of MDM2 by miR-222 was validated using a luciferase reporter. Our results indicate induction of genotoxicity in lymphocytes from workers with low exposure doses to BZ. In addition, miR-222 expression was up-regulated among both BZ-poisoned and BZ-exposed workers together with inverse association with DRC. Our in vitro validation studies using both cell lines indicate that 1,4-BQ exposure increased expression of miR-222 and Comet tail length but decreased DRC. Loss of miR-222 reduced DNA damage, but induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis. However, silencing of MDM2 failed to activate p53 in TK6 cells. In conclusion, our in vivo observations were confirmed by in vitro studies showing that BZ/1,4-BQ exposures caused genotoxicity and high expression of miR-222 which obstructed expression of the MDM2-p53 axis that led to failed activation of p53, abnormal DRC and serious biological consequences.",2021,"['Apoptosis', '*Benzene/toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",33071125,hsa-mir-222,yes,
"MicroRNA-494-dependent WDHDI inhibition suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tumor growth and metastasis in cholangiocarcinoma.","BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents a devastating malignancy characterized by high mortality, and notoriously problematic to diagnose. Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been intensively investigated due to their potential usefulness from a tumor treatment perspective. AIMS: The current study was aimed to investigate whether miR-494 influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor growth and metastasis of CCA. METHODS: The regulatory miRNAs of WDHD1 in CCA expression chip were predicted, followed by determination of the miR-494 and WDHD1 expression in normal cholangiocyte tissues and CCA tissues. The related protein levels were determined. CCA cell migration, invasion, viability, and cell cycle distribution and the dosage-dependent effect of miR-494 on CCA cell growth were subsequently detected. Finally, tumorigenicity and lymph node metastasis (LNM) were measured. RESULTS: Initially, miR-194 affected the CCA development via negatively regulating WDHD1 and miR-494 which were downregulated while WDHD1 was upregulated in CCA. In addition, miR-494 overexpression elevated E-cadherin expression while decreased expressions of WDHD1, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Twist and MMP-9. Finally, overexpressed miR-494 was observed to suppress EMT, cell viability, migration, invasion, arrest cell cycle progression, tumor formation, and LNM while accelerating cell apoptosis in vivo.

MiR-216b is involved in pathogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma through HBx-miR-216b-IGF2BP2 signaling pathway.,"This study aims to investigate the expression status of miRNA-216b in familial hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the correlation between miRNA-216b expression and pathogenesis, as well as the progression of HCC. The expression profile of miRNAs in plasma of peripheral blood between HCC patients with HCC family history and healthy volunteers without HCC family history was determined by microarray. Using real-time quantitative PCR to detect the expression in paired tissues from 150 patients with HCC, miR-216b was selected as its expression value in HCC patients was significantly lower compared with healthy volunteers. Next, miR-216b expression and the clinicopathological features of HCC were evaluated. The effect of miR-216b expression on tumor cells was investigated by regulating miR-216b expression in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we explored mRNA targets of miR-216b. In 150 HCC, 37 (75%) tumors showed reduced miR-216b expression comparing with their adjacent liver tissues. The decreased expression of miR-216b was significantly correlated with tumor volume (P=0.044), HBV infection (P=0.026), HBV DNA quantitative (P=0.001) and vascular invasion (P=0.032). The 5-year disease-free survival and overall rates after liver resection in low expression and high expression groups of miR-216b are 62% and 54%, 25% and 20%, respectively. MiR-216b overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and miR-216b inhibition did the opposite. The expression of hepatitis B virus x protein (HBx) has tight correlation with downregulation of miR-216b. Furthermore, miR-216b downregulated the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) and exerted its tumor-suppressor function through inhibition of protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling downstream of IGF2.

Transcriptional repression of miR-200 family members by Nanog in colon cancer,"Nanog is an important embryonic stem cell (ESC) gene that does not function as a classical oncogene, but needs to cooperate with other molecules to potentiate tumorigenic activity. The question addressed by the present study was whether a miRNA link exists between Nanog and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) plasticity. Here, we found that Nanog mRNA expression level was inversely correlated with miR-200c and miR-200b expression levels in colon cancer cell lines and human colorectal cancer tissues. Forced Nanog expression in low-Nanog colon cancer cells inhibited miR-200c and miR-200b expression, and interfered Nanog expression in high-Nanog colon cancer cells promoted miR-200c and miR-200b expression. Furthermore, we confirmed that Nanog directly repressed transcription of the miR-200c and miR-200b genes, and miR-200c and miR-200b mediated Nanog-induced EMT occurrence. Luciferase and ChIP assays determined that Nanog bound directly to the potential Nanog binding sites in the miR-200c and miR-200b promoters and repressed their transcription. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Nanog modulates EMT-MET plasticity by regulating miR-200 clusters via a direct transcriptional mechanism, and the Nanog-miR-200 axis may be a good therapeutic target for CRC control.",2017,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden']",28163188,hsa-mir-200b,yes,

MicroRNA-483-5p accentuates cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by targeting GPX3.,"The ability of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) toxicity to induce acute kidney injury (AKI) has attracted attention and concern for a long time, but the molecular mechanism of action for cisplatin is not clear. MicroRNA-483 is involved in several diseases, such as tumorigenesis and osteoarthritis, but its renal target and potential role in AKI are unknown. In this study, we explored the pathogenic role and underlying mechanism of miR-483-5p in cisplatin-induced AKI, using transgenic mice, clinical specimen, and in vitro cell line. We found that miR-483-5p was significantly upregulated by cisplatin in a cisplatin-induced mouse model, in serum samples of patients who received cisplatin therapy, and in NRK-52E cells. Overexpression of miR-483-5p in mouse kidneys by stereotactic renal injection of lentiviruses mediated miR-483-5p or generation of conditional miR-483-overexpressing transgenic mice accentuated cisplatin-induced AKI by increasing oxidative stress, promoting apoptosis, and inhibiting autophagy of tubular cells. Furthermore, our results revealed miR-483-5p directly targeted to GPX3, overexpression of which rescued cisplatin-induced AKI by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis of tubular cells, but not by regulating autophagy. Collectively, miR-483-5p is upregulated by cisplatin and exacerbates cisplatin-induced AKI via negative regulation of GPX3 and contributing oxidative stress and tubular cell apoptosis. These findings reveal a pathogenic role for miR-483-5p in cisplatin-induced AKI and suggest a novel target for the diagnosis and treatment of AKI.",2022 Jun,"['*Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cisplatin/toxicity', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Mice', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism']",35184139,hsa-mir-483,yes,
Down-regulation of microRNA-184 contributes to the development of cyanotic,"PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the roles of miR-184 in adaptation of hypoxic cardiomyocytes, as well as to elucidate the possible mechanisms of miR-184 in the development of cyanotic congenital heart diseases (CHD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to determine the expression of miR-184 in patients with cyanotic cardiac defects. The embryonic rat ventricular myocardial H9c2 cells were transfected with miR-184 inhibitor and negative scramble RNA. Mock group was untreated by anything. We then used MTT assay and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) to determine whether inhibition of miR-184 in vitro affect cell proliferation and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Besides, the expression levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in hypoxic H9c2 cells were determined by western blot. RESULTS: MiR-184 was significantly down-regulated in CHD patients with cyanotic cardiac defects. In addition, miR-184 was successfully inhibited in hypoxic H9c2 cells. Moreover, inhibition of miR-184 markedly decreased cell viability and obviously induced apoptosis under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Besides, the expression levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in hypoxic H9c2 were significantly increased after miR-184 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that inhibition of microRNA-184 may contribute to the development of cyanotic CHD via decreasing proliferation and inducing apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.

Effect of avian influenza A H5N1 infection on the expression of microRNA-141 in human respiratory epithelial cells.,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza remains a serious threat to human health. The consequence of human infection varies markedly among different subtypes of avian influenza viruses.

This study aims at elucidating how avian influenza infection perturbs the host's miRNA regulatory pathways that may lead to adverse pathological events, such as cytokine storm, using the miRNA microarray approach. RESULTS: The results showed that dysregulation of miRNA expression was mainly observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 infection. We found that miR-21*, miR-100*, miR-141, miR-574-3p, miR-1274a and miR1274b were differentially expressed in response to influenza A virus infection. Interestingly, we demonstrated that miR-141, which was more highly induced by H5N1 than by H1N1 (p < 0.05), had an ability to suppress the expression of a cytokine - transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2. This was supported by the observation that the inhibitory effect could be reversed by antagomiR-141. CONCLUSIONS: Since TGF-beta2 is an important cytokine that can act as both an immunosuppressive agent and a potent proinflammatory molecule through its ability to attract and regulate inflammatory molecules, and previous report showed that only seasonal influenza H1N1 (but not the other avian influenza subtypes) could induce a persistent expression of TGF-beta2, we speculate that the modulation of TGF-beta2 expression by different influenza subtypes via miR-141 might be a critical step for determining the outcome of either normal or excessive inflammation progression.",2013 May 10,"['Cell Line', 'Epithelial Cells/*virology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/*pathogenicity', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis']",23663545,hsa-mir-574,no,
miRNA identification by nuclease digestion in ELISA for diagnosis of,"Osteosarcoma is a bone cancer formed by the cells of the bone. Children, young adults, and teens are highly affected by osteosarcoma. Early identification of osteosarcoma is mandatory to improve the treatment and increase the lifespan of the patients. MicroRNA-195 (miR-195) was shown to be a suitable biomarker for osteosarcoma, and the present study describes a sensitive method of miR-195 identification by nuclease digestion in ELISA to detect and quantify the level of miR-195. S1 nuclease catalyzed endo- and exonucleolytic digestion of single-stranded (ss) RNA and DNA on ELISA polystyrene substrate, which helped to identify duplexed miR-195. This method selectively and specifically identified miR-195 without any biofouling interactions and reached the limit of detection at 10 fM within the range from 10 fM to 10 nM. Due to complete digestion of ssDNA, single- and triple-mismatched sequences failed to increase the ELISA signal, indicating specific miRNA detection. Furthermore, human serum spiked with miR-195 did not interfere with the detection, confirming selective identification. This method identified miR-195 at a lower level and will help to diagnose earlier stages of osteosarcoma.",2022,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Child', 'Digestion', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', '*Osteosarcoma/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Young Adult']",34081808,hsa-mir-195,no,
MicroRNA expression profiles in the granulosa cells of infertile patients undergoing progestin primed ovarian stimulation.,"RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Does Progesterone primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol influence the microRNA expression profiles of granulosa cells of follicular fluid in infertile patients? Will adding progestins in the follicular phase affect follicular microenvironment? DESIGN: This was a prospective study with granulosa cells collected from patients who received PPOS protocol (n = 15) and who received gonadotropin releasing hormones (GnRH) antagonist protocol (n = 15). MicroRNA sequencing was set to find differently expressed microRNAs. The most significant statistically differential expressed miRNAs are chosen to be validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) following by target genes prediction and enrichment analysis. RESULTS: The microRNA sequencing found 24 up-regulated miRNAs and 37 down-regulated miRNA among which 10 microRNAs (miR-4697-5p, miR-6788-5p, miR-6869-5p, miR-4644, miR-199a-5p, miR-6801-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR-4261, miR-199a-3p, miR-150-5p) can be detected in all sequencing samples and rank top enrichment scores in all microRNAs. The PCR validation showed that the down-regulation of miR-4261 and up-regulation of miR-6869-5p were consistent with the sequencing results. Putative genes were identified to be confidently predictive. The enrichment analysis showed that the most enriched gene ontology terms involves cell proliferation and apoptosis and the most enriched pathway included Hippo signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: PPOS protocol could up-regulate the expression of miR-6869-5p and down-regulate the expression of miR-4261 in granulosa cells of follicular fluid in infertile patients which involves a lot of cellular and molecular mechanisms requiring follow-up studies.",2022 Sep,"['Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulosa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Ovulation Induction', '*Progestins', 'Prospective Studies']",35952470,hsa-mir-4261,no,
lncRNA CYTOR promotes tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells via sponging,"Development of resistance to endocrine therapy, such as tamoxifen, remains a tricky clinical problem during the treatment of breast cancer. Accumulating evidence suggested that dysregulation of long noncoding (lnc_RNAs contributes to the development of tamoxifen resistance. In the current study, via screening, cytoskeleton regulator RNA (CYTOR) was identified as the most significantly elevated lncRNA in the established tamoxifen resistant MCF7 cell lines (MCF7/TAM1 and MCF7/TAM2) compared with the parental MCF7 cells (MCF7ѓ??P). The CCKѓ??8 assay indicated that silencing of CYTOR increased the sensitivity of MCF7/TAM1 and MCF7/TAM2 to tamoxifen treatment. Using bioinformatic analysis, it was predicted that microRNA (miR)ѓ??125aѓ??5p might bind to CYTOR and the expression of miRѓ??125aѓ??5p was negatively correlated with CYTOR in the tumor tissues of breast cancer. In addition, RTѓ??qPCR and dual luciferase assays validated that CYTOR directly repressed miRѓ??125aѓ??5p expression in breast cancer cells. Through regulation of miRѓ??125aѓ??5p, CYTOR elevated serum response factor (SRF) expression and activated Hippo and mitogen associated protein kinase signaling pathways to promote breast cancer cell survival upon tamoxifen treatment. In the collected tumor tissues of breast cancer in the present study, high expression of CYTOR was detected in tissues from patients with no response to tamoxifen compared with those from patients who were not treated with tamoxifen. A positive correlation between CYTOR and SRF mRNA expression was observed in tissues collected from patients with breast cancer. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated a pivotal role of CYTOR in mediating tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.",2020,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",31894257,hsa-mir-125a,yes,
miR-375 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of glioblastoma by regulating,"The aberrant expression of microRNA-375 (miR-375) has been proved to be associated with carcinogenesis. However, the role of miR-375 in glioblastoma (GBM) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate biological functions and its molecular mechanisms of miR-375 in GBM cells. In this study, real-time PCR results showed that the level of miR-375 expression in GBM tissues and GBM cell lines (U87 and U251) was decreased. Using MTT assay, Transwell migration and invasion assay, we demonstrated that miR-375 overexpression significantly suppress cell proliferation, cell migration and cell invasion capacity in U87 and U251 cells. However, downregulation of miR-375 had reverse effects on cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Targeting association analysis, dual luciferase assay, RT-PCR and western blot analysis results confirmed that miR-375 could target the 3'UTR of Wnt5a mRNA and regulated its protein expression. Further studies also find overexpression of Wnt5a could significantly reverse miR-375-mediated proliferation, migration and invasion on U87 and U251 cells. Therefore, we concluded that miR-375 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of GBM by regulating Wnt5a and might be a possible therapeutic agent for GBM.",2019,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Glioblastoma/genetics/physiopathology', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', '*Wnt-5a Protein/genetics/metabolism']",30784283,hsa-mir-375,yes,
Identification of microRNAs that regulate TLR2-mediated trophoblast apoptosis and,"While infection-induced placental inflammation is a common mechanism of adverse pregnancy outcome, some pathogens can also trigger placental apoptosis, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate this response. Treatment of human first trimester trophoblast cells with bacterial peptidoglycan (PDG) reduces their constitutive secretion of IL-6 protein and induces apoptosis. This apoptotic response is dependent upon the cell's expression of TLR1, TLR2 and TLR10, and their lack of TLR6, such that ectopic expression of TLR6 prevents PDG-induced apoptosis and restores IL-6 production. In this current study we have identified three microRNAs (miRs) that regulate TLR2-mediated responses in the human trophoblast. Herein we report that miR-329 plays a pivotal role in mediating PDG-induced trophoblast apoptosis and inhibition of IL-6 mRNA expression by targeting the NF-?§B subunit, p65. TLR2 activation by PDG upregulates miR-329 expression and inhibits NF-?§B p65 and IL-6 mRNA, and this is reversed by the presence of TLR6. Moreover, inhibition of miR-329 prevents PDG-induced inhibition of NF-?§B p65 and IL-6 mRNA expression, and restores cell survival. In addition, we have found miR-23a and let-7c to directly regulate PDG-mediated inhibition of IL-6 mRNA. TLR2 activation by PDG upregulates miR23a and let-7c expression and this is reversed by the presence of TLR6. Furthermore, inhibition of both miR23a and let-7c prevents PDG-inhibition of trophoblast IL-6 mRNA expression. Together, our findings suggest that multiple miRs are involved in the molecular regulation of TLR2-mediated responses in the trophoblast towards gram-positive bacterial components.",2013,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptidoglycan/pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 6/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",24143215,hsa-mir-23a,no,shows effect on cellular phenotype but not disease
Association of microRNA expression with microsatellite instability status in,"MicroRNAs (miRNA), small noncoding RNAs, are potential diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as therapeutic targets. miRNA profiles of colorectal carcinomas have not been studied extensively in the context of microsatellite instability (MSI) status. We therefore evaluated 55 paired colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) and non-neoplastic mucosa samples using a panel of 24 miRNAs selected by literature review and prior studies in our laboratory. Stem-loop reverse transcriptase quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction assays were done on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of resection specimens. When miRNA expression was compared with clinicopathologic features and MSI status, eleven miRNAs (miR-183, -31, -20, -25, -92, -93, -17, -135a, -203, -133b, and -223) were over-expressed in CRC relative to mucosa, and nine (miR-192, -215, -26b, -143, -145, -191, -196a, -16, and let-7a) were under-expressed in CRC. Relative expression of miR-92, -223, -155, -196a, -31, and -26b were significantly different among MSI subgroups, and miR-31 and miR-223 were overexpressed in CRC of patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (Lynch syndrome).

Longitudinal monitoring reveals dynamic changes in circulating tumor cells (CTCs),"We evaluated the changes in CTC count and CTC-associated miRNAs during the course of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Blood samples were collected from 9 metastatic colorectal cancer patients prior to chemotherapy and at every other chemotherapy session during the course of treatment. CTCs were isolated and enumerated using a size-exclusion method (CellSievo, Singapore). CTC-associated miRNAs were isolated using a paper-based, partitioning method, and analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (MiRXES, Singapore). CTC count trends generally correlated with disease progression defined by radiological measurements and trends in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels; hence CTC counts may be useful in cases where CEA is not elevated. CTC-associated miRNAs identified were miR-15b, miR-16, miR-19a, miR-21, miR-25, miR-30d, miR-126, miR-185, miR-221, miR-222, and miR-324-5p.

"CDKN2A, NF2, and JUN are dysregulated among other genes by miRNAs in malignant mesothelioma -A miRNA microarray analysis.","Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive cancer arising from mesothelial cells, mainly due to former asbestos exposure. Little is known about the microRNA (miRNA) expression of MM. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs, which play an essential role in the regulation of gene expression. This study was carried out to analyze the miRNA expression profile of 17 MM samples using miRNA microarray. The analysis distinguished the overall miRNA expression profiles of tumor tissue and normal mesothelium. Differentially expressed miRNAs were found in tumor samples compared with normal sample. Twelve of them, let-7b*, miR-1228*, miR-195*, miR-30b*, miR-32*, miR-345, miR-483-3p, miR-584, miR-595, miR-615-3p, and miR-885-3p, were highly expressed whereas the remaining nine, let-7e*, miR-144*, miR-203, miR-340*, miR-34a*, miR-423, miR-582, miR-7-1*, and miR-9, were unexpressed or had severely reduced expression levels. Target genes for these miRNAs include the most frequently affected genes in MM such as CDKN2A, NF2, JUN, HGF, and PDGFA. Many of the miRNAs were located in chromosomal areas known to be deleted or gained in MM such as 8q24, 1p36, and 14q32. Furthermore, we could identify specific miRNAs for each histopathological subtype of MM. Regarding risk factors such as smoking status and asbestos exposure, significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in smokers versus nonsmokers (miR-379, miR-301a, miR-299-3p, miR-455-3p, and miR-127-3p), but not in asbestos-exposed patients versus nonexposed ones.

miR-718 is involved in malignancy of papillary thyroid cancer through repression of PDPK1.,"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs bind the 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of mRNAs and thereby regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and play an important role in cancer delvelopment. In the present study, we have explored the role of miR-718 in papillary thyroid cancer cell malignancy. MATERIALS/METHODS: Here we examined the miRNA expression in human papillary thyroid cancer by RT-PCR. Luciferase activity, RT-PCR and western blot assays were used to confirmed the target of miRNA. MTT, colony formation, transwell, glucose consumption and lactate production assays were performed to analyze papillary thyroid cancer cell function. Western blot for signaling proteins was used to reveal the mechanism. RESULTS: We first determined that miR-718 mRNA expression levels in PTC samples were reduced. The 3'-UTR of 3-Phosphoinositide Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (PDPK1) was then identified as a target of miR-718. Luciferase assays showed that miR-718 does in fact bind the wild-type PDPK1 3'-UTR. We assessed the effects of miR-718 on p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR and mTOR expression. We determined that miR-718 negatively regulates their levels, respectively, of Akt-mTOR pathway components. We then assessed the effects of miR-718 on PTC cell behavior. The results revealed that miR-718 negatively regulates PTC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, miR-718 was found to inhibit cell glucose metabolism, likely through the Akt-mTOR pathway. Finally, PDPK1 could rescue PTC cell inhibition induced by miR-718. CONCLUSIONS: The present study strongly suggests that miR-718 inhibits PTC cell proliferation, metastasis, and glucose metabolism by negatively regulating the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.",2018 Nov,"['3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",30166214,hsa-mir-718,yes,

Upregulated UBE4B expression correlates with poor prognosis and tumor immune,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major human health concern. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that ubiquitin ligase E4B (UBE4B) may be involved in the occurrence and development of various human cancers and may affect prognosis. However, the specific role and mechanism of UBE4B in HCC is unclear. METHODS: A pan-cancer analysis of UBE4B expression, clinicopathological features, and prognosis was performed using bioinformatics techniques. Subsequently, the expression, prognosis, and correlation of UBE4B and its upstream miRNAs and lncRNAs were analyzed. We investigated the relationship between UBE4B expression and immune cell infiltration, immunomodulatory factors, and chemokines in HCC. The expression levels of UBE4B and its upstream lncRNAs (FGD5-AS1, LINC00858, and SNHG16) and miRNAs (hsa-miR-22-3p) were evaluated in HCC cell lines using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: UBE4B expression increased in HCC and was correlated with a poor survival rate in patients with HCC. A ceRNA network was established to identify the UBE4B-hsa-miR-22-3p-FGD5-AS1/LINC00858/SNHG16 regulatory axis in HCC. UBE4B expression was significantly associated with immune cell infiltration, immunomodulators, chemokines, and their receptors in HCC. The mRNA expression of FGD5-AS1, LINC00858, SNHG16, and UBE4B was higher in the HCC cell lines (7721 and HepG2) than in the normal hepatocyte line (LO2), and the expression of hsa-miR-22-3p mRNA showed a decreasing trend.

Molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer based on miRNA expression profiles have independent prognostic value.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Altered microRNAs (miRNA) expression, a typical feature of many cancers, is reportedly associated with prognosis according to several studies. Although numerous studies on miRNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have also attempted to identify prognostic biomarkers, more large-scale clinical studies are needed to establish the clinical significance of the results. Present study aimed to identify prognosis-related molecular subtypes of primary pancreas tumors using miRNA expression profiling. METHODS: Expression profiles of 1733 miRNAs were obtained by using microarray analysis of 104 pancreatic tumors of Korean patients. To detect subgroups informative in predicting the patient's prognosis, we applied unsupervised clustering methods and then analyzed the association of the molecular subgroups with survival time. Then, we constructed a classifier to predict the subgroup using penalized regression models. RESULTS: We have determined three pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor subtypes associated with prognosis based on miRNA expression profiles. These subtypes showed significantly different survival time for patients with the same clinical conditions. This demonstrates that our prognostic molecular subgroup has independent prognostic utility. The molecular subtypes can be predicted with a classifier of 19 miRNAs. Of the 19 signature miRNAs, miR-106b-star, miR-324-3p, and miR-615 were related to a p53 canonical pathway, and miR-324, miR-145-5p, miR-26b-5p, and miR-574-3p were related to a Cox-2 centered pathway.

Our study aimed to explore the role of miR-146a in the pathology of retinoblastoma. Potential target gene of miR-146a was predicted by Targetscan. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that miR-146a was downregulated and ventral nerve tumor antigen 1 (Neuro - oncological ventral antigen 1, NOVA1) was upregulated in retinoblastoma. Luciferase assay confirmed that miR-146a directly target NOVA1. MiR-146a knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed and found that miR-146a could regulate the expression of NOVA1. The miR-146a knockdown and overexpression experiments were conducted to investigate the biological function of miR-146a.

Bladder cancer-associated transcript 1 promotes melanoma cell proliferation and invasion via the miR-374b-5p/U2-associated factor homology motif kinase 1 axis.,"Melanoma is a malignancy derived from melanocytes and is associated with high mortality rates worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed to be pivotal regulators in multiple types of cancer. Many lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in tumors and perform vital functions in cancer progression. Nevertheless, the biological role of lncRNA bladder cancer-associated transcript 1 (BLACAT1) in melanoma progression remains unexplored. In this study, the collected data showed that BLACAT1 was highly expressed in melanoma. Mechanistically, miR-374b-5p bound to BLACAT1, and U2-associated factor homology motif kinase 1 (UHMK1) was a downstream target of miR-374b-5p. BLACAT1 upregulated UHMK1 expression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-374-5b. BLACAT1 deficiency resulted in the upregulation of miR-374b-5p expression and the downregulation of UHMK1 expression in melanoma cells. Moreover, BLACAT1 activated PI3K and AKT signaling by upregulating UHMK1 expression, as shown by western blotting analyses. Functionally, UHMK1 overexpression or miR-374b-5p knockdown reversed the suppressive effect of BLACAT1 depletion on melanoma cell proliferation and invasion. In conclusion, BLACAT1 promotes melanoma cell proliferation and invasion by upregulating UHMK1 expression via miR-374b-5p to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway.

MiR-210 and miR-155 as potential diagnostic markers for pre-eclampsia,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is one of the leading causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

The real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction has been utilized to estimate the Ct values in both groups.Our results have shown that miR-210 and miR-155 were upregulated in serum of PE pregnancies, which suggest a potential association between these 2 miRNAs and the pathogenesis of PE.

Long non-coding RNA TUSC8 inhibits breast cancer growth and metastasis via miR-190b-5p/MYLIP axis.,"The lncRNA tumor suppressor candidate 8 (TUSC8) plays a critical role in the development of several cancers. However, the biological functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of TUSC8 with respect to breast cancer remain largely unclear. Here, we found that TUSC8 was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and its high expression predicted better prognosis of breast cancer patients. Functionally, knock-down of TUSC8 drastically promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and facilitated tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, the results of luciferase reporter, RIP and RNA pull-down assays proved that TUSC8 functioned as molecular sponge for miR-190b-5p. Furthermore, we showed that TUSC8 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein (MYLIP) through competitively binding with miR-190b-5p and suppressed breast cancer metastasis through regulating the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related markers. Clinically, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses revealed that the combination usage of TUSC8 and MYLIP might become novel promising diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer. Taken together, these results suggested that TUSC8 inhibited breast cancer growth and metastasis via miR-190b-5p/MYLIP axis, providing us new insights into developing potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer patients.",2020 Feb 9,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",32039833,hsa-mir-190b,yes,
Differentially expressed microRNAs in pancreatic cancer stem cells.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze and identify pancreatic cancer stem cell-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to investigate their correlations to cancer stem cell biology. METHODS: We used sphere cultivation methods to enrich the stem cell population and analyzed overall miRNA and mRNA expressions using microarray analysis. RESULTS: Differentially expressed miRNAs including miR-99a, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-192, and miR-429 were detected in pancreatic cancer stem cells. Furthermore, examining both profiles, we obtained 210 miRNAs and 258 stem cell-associated mRNAs that were differentially expressed in the pancreatic cancer stem cells. These miRNAs and mRNAs were further investigated using cross-correlation analysis, which yielded 6 groups of miRNAs and 3 groups of mRNAs. The number of miRNA clusters and mRNA clusters showed high correlation based on microarray result. CONCLUSIONS: Differentially expressed miRNAs in pancreatic cancer stem cells provide insights into possible linkages between clusters of miRNAs and clusters of stem cell-associated mRNAs in cancer stem cells and have broad implications in our understanding of cancer stem cells and cancer stem cell-targeted cancer therapy.",2011,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spheroids, Cellular/metabolism/pathology']",21785383,hsa-mir-99a,no,
MicroRNA-137 is downregulated in glioblastoma and inhibits the stemness of glioma,"Glioblastomas (GBM), the most common and aggressive malignant astrocytic tumors, contain a small subpopulation of cancer stem cells (GSCs) that are implicated in therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. Here, we study the expression and function of miR-137, a putative suppressor miRNA, in GBM and GSCs. We found that the expression of miR-137 was significantly lower in GBM and GSCs compared to normal brains and neural stem cells (NSCs) and that the miR-137 promoter was hypermethylated in the GBM specimens. The expression of miR-137 was increased in differentiated NSCs and GSCs and overexpression of miR-137 promoted the neural differentiation of both cell types. Moreover, pre-miR-137 significantly decreased the self-renewal of GSCs and the stem cell markers Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and Shh. We identified RTVP-1 as a novel target of miR-137 in GSCs; transfection of the cells with miR-137 decreased the expression of RTVP-1 and the luciferase activity of RTVP-1 3'-UTR reporter plasmid. Furthermore, overexpression of RTVP-1 plasmid lacking its 3'-UTR abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-137 on the self-renewal of GSCs. Silencing of RTVP-1 decreased the self-renewal of GSCs and the expression of CXCR4 and overexpression of CXCR4 abrogated the inhibitory effect of RTVP-1 silencing on GSC self-renewal. These results demonstrate that miR-137 is downregulated in GBM probably due to promoter hypermethylation. miR-137 inhibits GSC self-renewal and promotes their differentiation by targeting RTVP-1 which downregulates CXCR4. Thus, miR-137 and RTVP-1 are attractive therapeutic targets for the eradication of GSCs and for the treatment of GBM.",2013,"['Brain/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hedgehog Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/biosynthesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*biosynthesis', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",23714687,hsa-mir-137,yes,
Validation of expression patterns for nine miRNAs in 204 lymph-node negative breast cancers.,"INTRODUCTION: Although lymph node negative (LN-) breast cancer patients have a good 10-years survival ( approximately 85%), most of them still receive adjuvant therapy, while only some benefit from this. More accurate prognostication of LN- breast cancer patient may reduce over- and under-treatment. Until now proliferation is the strongest prognostic factor for LN- breast cancer patients. The small molecule microRNA (miRNA) has opened a new window for prognostic markers, therapeutic targets and/or therapeutic components. Previously it has been shown that miR-18a/b, miR-25, miR-29c and miR-106b correlate to high proliferation. METHODS: The current study validates nine miRNAs (miR-18a/b miR-25, miR-29c, miR-106b, miR375, miR-424, miR-505 and let-7b) significantly correlated with established prognostic breast cancer biomarkers. Total RNA was isolated from 204 formaldehyde-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) LN- breast cancers and analyzed with quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Independent T-test was used to detect significant correlation between miRNA expression level and the different clinicopathological features for breast cancer. RESULTS: Strong and significant associations were observed for high expression of miR-18a/b, miR-106b, miR-25 and miR-505 to high proliferation, oestrogen receptor negativity and cytokeratin 5/6 positivity. High expression of let-7b, miR-29c and miR-375 was detected in more differentiated tumours. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high miR-106b expression had an 81% survival rate vs. 95% (P = 0.004) for patients with low expression. CONCLUSION: High expression of miR-18a/b are strongly associated with basal-like breast cancer features, while miR-106b can identify a group with higher risk for developing distant metastases in the subgroup of Her2 negatives. Furthermore miR-106b can identify a group of patients with 100% survival within the otherwise considered high risk group of patients with high proliferation. Using miR-106b as a biomarker in conjunction to mitotic activity index could thereby possibly save 18% of the patients with high proliferation from overtreatment.",2012,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",23144930,hsa-mir-505,no,
Modulation of miRNA expression by dietary polyphenols in apoE deficient mice: a,"BACKGROUND: Polyphenols are the most abundant antioxidants in the human diet and are widespread constituents of fruits and beverages, such as tea, coffee or wine. Epidemiological, clinical and animal studies support a role of polyphenols in the prevention of various diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers or neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings suggest that polyphenols could interact with cellular signaling cascades regulating the activity of transcription factors and consequently affecting the expression of genes. However, the impact of polyphenol on the expression of microRNA, small non-coding RNAs, has not yet been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of dietary supplementation with polyphenols at nutritional doses on miRNA expression in the livers of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (apoEѓЃЇ/ѓЃЇ) jointly with mRNA expression profiling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using microarrays, we measured the global miRNA expression in the livers of wild-type (C57B6/J) mice or apoEѓЃЇ/ѓЃЇ mice fed diets supplemented with one of nine different polyphenols or a control diet. This analysis revealed that knock-out of the apoE gene induced significant modulation in the expression of miRNA. Moreover, changes in miRNA expression were observed after polyphenol supplementation, and five miRNAs (mmu-miR-291b-5p, mmu-miR-296-5p, mmu-miR-30c-1*, mmu-miR-467b* and mmu-miR-374*) were identified as being commonly modulated by these polyphenols. We also observed that these polyphenols counteracted the modulation of miRNA expression induced by apoE mutation. Pathway analyses on these five miRNA-target genes revealed common pathways, some of which were also identified from a pathway analysis on mRNA profiles. CONCLUSION: This in vivo study demonstrated for the first time that polyphenols at nutritional doses modulate the expression of miRNA in the liver. Even if structurally different, all polyphenols induced a similar miRNA expression profile. Common pathways were identified from both miRNA-target and mRNA analysis, revealing cellular functions that could be regulated by polyphenols at both the miRNA and mRNA level.",2012,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Diet', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polyphenols/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",22253797,hsa-mir-296,no,"doesn't mention human miRs, including has-miR-296"
Increased SIX-1 expression promotes breast cancer metastasis by regulating,"Patients with advanced breast cancer (BC) showed a higher incidence of regional and distant metastases. Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX-1) has been confirmed to be a key tumorigenic and metastatic regulator in BC progression. Yet, molecular mechanisms behind SIX-1-induced BC metastases remain largely unknown. Here we found that SIX-1 was frequently up-regulated in BC and correlated with poor outcomes when tested in human BC tissue microarray. Then, we manipulated the expression of SIX-1 by via shRNA-mediated knockdown and lentivirus-mediated overexpression. Transwell assay in vitro and lung metastases model of nude mice in vivo showed that SIX-1 promoted BC cell invasion and migration in vitro, and facilitated metastases in vivo. Mechanistically, SIX-1 could promote the transcription of lncATB, which exerts critical pro-metastatic role in BC by directly binding to the miR-200 family, especially for miR-200c, to induce EMT and promote metastases. In conclusion, SIX-1 exerts its pro-metastatic role in BC through lncATB/miR-200s axis of EMT signalling pathway and could act as an important diagnostic marker as well as a significant therapeutic target for clinically advanced BC.",2020,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1/genetics/*metabolism']",32227618,hsa-mir-200c,no,
[Bioinformatics analysis of the microRNA expression profile in the peripheral,"This study aimed to investigate the differential expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes between patients with essential hypertension and healthy individuals in Xinjiang Kazakh and to provide insight into the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in this ethnic group. From April 2016 to May 2019, 30 Kazakh patients with essential hypertension in the inpatient and outpatient departments of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University were used as the hypertension group; 30 healthy Kazakh patients were used as the control group. The miRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 6 Kazakh hypertensive patients and 6 matched healthy individuals were compared, and the differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed by cluster analysis, GSEA enrichment analysis, target gene prediction, target gene annotation and other bioinformatics analyses. In addition, qRT-PCR was used to verify the differentially expressed miRNAs. The results showed that compared with the control group, 73 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in the hypertension group, of which 39 miRNAs were up-regulated and 34 miRNAs were down-regulated. A total of 11 miRNAs related to hypertension were screened by GSEA enrichment analysis, including hsa-miR-100-5p, hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-299-5p, hsa-miR-299-3p, hsa-miR-296-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-503-5p, hsa-miR-628-5p, hsa-miR-874-3p, hsa-miR-543 and hsa-miR-940. qRT-PCR test found that the expression of hsa-miR-100-5p, hsa-miR-299-5p, hsa-miR-299-3p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-503-5p, hsa-miR-628-5p and hsa-miR-543 was up-regulated, while the expression of hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-296-5p, hsa-miR-874-3p and hsa-miR-940 was down-regulated in the hypertension group compared with the control group. The expression trend in the gene chip was consistent with the results verified by qRT-PCR. Using online database to predict target genes of 11 miRNAs related to hypertension, we found that a total of 1 647 target genes might be regulated by these 11 miRNAs. GO function enrichment showed that (a) in biological processes, the predicted hypertension related target genes are mainly relevant to nervous system development, cellular localization, regulation of cellular metabolic process, generation of neurons and positive regulation of biological process; (b) In terms of cellular components, they are mainly related to membrane-bounded organelle, cytoplasm, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, synapse part, neuron part, and nucleoplasm; (c) In terms of molecular function, they are mainly related to protein binding, transcription regulatory region DNA binding, RNA polymerase II regulatory region DNA binding, transcription regulator activity, and ion binding. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the p53 signaling pathway, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, cAMP signaling pathway, TGF-?э signaling pathway, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, mTOR signaling pathway, and aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption may be related to the occurrence and development of hypertension. In conclusion, there are significant differences in the expression of miRNAs in peripheral blood lymphocytes between Kazakh patients with essential hypertension and healthy people. The differentially expressed miRNAs may be related to the occurrence and development of essential hypertension in Kazakh. However, the underlying mechanism needs to be further explored and verified.",2022,"['Humans', '*Computational Biology', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Lymphocytes', 'China', 'DNA']",36319098,hsa-mir-150,no,
Inhibition of miR-664a interferes with the migration of osteosarcoma cells via modulation of MEG3.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in children and adolescents. Understanding the basic molecular mechanisms in developing cancer can be helpful in developing alternative treatment strategies. The relationship between dysregulated non-coding RNAs' (ncRNA) expression level and osteosarcoma was detected. Among those ncRNAs, the expression levels of miR-664a were detected to be upregulated and MEG3 long non-coding RNA levels were detected to be downregulated in osteosarcoma tissue and cell lines. In this study, miR-664a inhibitor was used in order to investigate the changes in the expression levels of MEG3 gene and miR-664a in osteosarcoma cancer cell line (U2-OS) and human osteoblast cell line (hFOB 1.19). According to our results, the expression level of MEG3 gene was increased while the expression level of miR-664a was decreased, as expected. In addition, changes in expression level of MEG3 and miR-644a interferes with the migration of osteosarcoma cells migration speed of osteosarcoma cells. These results are found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). As a result of this study, it was shown that the upregulated expression of miR-664a could have an inhibitory effect on MEG3 gene expression and migration of osteosarcoma cells.",2017 Aug 26,"['Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Bone and Bones/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",28669734,hsa-mir-664a,yes,
Impact of miRNAs expression modulation on the methylation status of breast cancer,"PURPOSE: Altered miRNAs play a crucial role in the emergence of the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype. The interplay between miRNAs and methylation enzymes has been documented. One of the most aggressive breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, has expressed much more DNMT3B than DNMT3A. This study aims to evaluate the ability of miR-203 restoration and miR-150 inhibition to regulate DNMT3B and DNMT3A to modify the methylation level of BCSC-associated genes. METHODS: MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-203 mimic or miR-150 inhibitor or DNMT3B siRNA, and downstream analysis was performed by flow cytometry, real-time PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: DNMT3A and DNMT3B are regulated both by miR-203a-3p and miR-150-5p. Transfection with miR-203 mimic and miR-150 inhibitor significantly reduced the CD44(+)CD24(-) subpopulation and down-regulated the expression of CD44 mRNA by increasing promoter methylation levels. SiRNA knockdown of DNMT3B increased the CD44(+)CD24(-) subpopulation and the expression of CD44 and ALDH1A3 by decreasing methylation density. The inhibition of miR-150 down-regulated OCT3/4 and SOX2 expression without affecting methylation levels, while miR-203 restoration and miR-150 inhibition down-regulated NANOG expression by elevating the methylation level. A positive-feedback loop was found between miR-203 and its target DNMT3B, as restoring miR-203 suppressed DNMT3B, while knocking down DNMT3B up-regulated miR-203. The restoration of miR-203 and knockdown of DNMT3B decreased methylation levels and increased the expression of miR-141 and miR-200c.

Extracellular microRNAs from the epididymis as potential mediators of cell-to-cell communication.,"Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was previously thought to remain inside cells as an intermediate between genes and proteins during translation. However, it is now estimated that 98% of the mammalian genomic output is transcribed as noncoding RNAs, which are involved in diverse gene expression regulatory mechanisms and can be transferred from one cell to another through extracellular communication. For instance, microRNAs are 22-nucleotide-long noncoding RNAs that are generated by endonuclease cleavage of precursors inside the cells and are secreted as extracellular microRNAs to regulate target cell posttranscriptional gene expression via RNA interference. We and others have shown that different populations of microRNAs are expressed in distinct regions of the human epididymis and regulate the expression of target genes that are involved in the control of male fertility as indicated by knock-out mouse models. Importantly, some microRNAs, including the microRNA-888 (miR-888) cluster that is exclusively expressed in the reproductive system of human and nonhuman primates, are released in the sperm-surrounding fluid in the epididymis via extracellular vesicles, the so-called epididymosomes. In addition to interacting with the membrane of maturing spermatozoa, these extracellular vesicles containing microRNAs communicate with epithelial cells located downstream from their release site, suggesting a role in the luminal exocrine control of epididymal functions. Apart from their potential roles as mediators of intercellular communication within the epididymis, these extracellular microRNAs are potent molecular targets for the noninvasive diagnosis of male infertility.",2015 Sep-Oct,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Epididymis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sperm Maturation/*physiology', 'Spermatozoa/*metabolism']",26178395,hsa-mir-888,no,
MicroRNA-210 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting regulator of,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate protein biosynthesis and participate in the pathogenesis of various tumours. Previous studies have shown that miR-210 is highly expressed in different types of human cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the role that miR-210 plays in GBM remains unclear. Here, we detected the expression and examined the function of miRNA-210 in GBM cells. Furthermore, we investigated the possible molecular mechanisms by which miRNA-210 mediates cell proliferation and apoptosis. Fifteen GBM and five normal brain tissues, in addition to the U87MG and U251 GBM cell lines, were analysed in this study. We found that miR-210 was upregulated in GBM tissues and cell lines when compared to normal brain tissue. Cell counting and flow cytometric assay results demonstrated that upregulation of miR-210 induced cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis, respectively. In addition, downregulation of miR-210 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. We also detected a miR-210 target, regulator of differentiation 1 (ROD1), which is involved in GBM progression. Knockdown of ROD1 reversed the growth arrest and apoptosis that were originally induced by miR-210 inhibition.

Design and Fabrication of a DNA-copper Nanocluster-based Biosensor for Multiple,"Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers and a significant cause of fatalities in women. Diagnosis of breast cancer faces substantial challenges, owing to the multi-factored nature of the illness. Thus, the necessity for an inexpensive, rapid, and non-invasive diagnostic method that enables early detection with high sensitivity and specificity is of primary significance. In this study, a biosensor based on the fluorescence emission of DNA-templated Cu nanoclusters was designed to simultaneously detect and quantify three significant biomarkers of breast cancer (circulating microRNAs, miR-21, miR-195, and miR-155). Fluorescence spectroscopy, FESEM and TEM microscopy, and DLS confirmed the validation of the biosensor. A detection limit of 1.7 pM with a linearity range of 500 nM to 3 ?жM was obtained.

Long Noncoding RNA LINC00460 Promotes Cell Progression by Sponging miR-4443 in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs were proved to be associated with the development and progression in HNSCC. However, the mechanism of LINC00460 in HNSCC needs to be further investigated. The study used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the expression of LINC00460 in cancer tissues and cell lines. Gain and loss of function experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of LINC00460 and miR-4443 on cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of HNSCC cells in vitro.

Functionally, knockdown of LINC00460 inhibited HNSCC cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Besides, LINC00460 promoted cell progression by sponging miR-4443, and miR-4443 inhibitor could reverse the effects of si-LINC00460 on cell proliferation and migration.

Significance of Polymorphism and Expression of miR-146a and NFkB1 Genetic,"MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory innate immune responses, and found to be differentially expressed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Through NF-?§B pathway, this molecule is able to stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?с, IL-1?э, and IL-17. It has been also suggested that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA sequences may alter miRNA expression and that miR-146a rs2910164 SNP may contribute to RA development. These observations prompted us to analyze the potential associations between the miR-146a-3p (rs2910164, G > C) and NFkB1 (rs28362491, ins/del ATTG) polymorphisms and miR-146a-5p expression in patients' sera in relation to clinical outcome of the treatment as well as predisposition to RA. Genotyping was performed in 111 patients and 130 healthy individuals while 16 controls and 13 RA patients (before and after three months of therapy with TNF-?с inhibitors (TNFi)) were studied for the circulating miR-146a-5p serum expression level. Patients carrying the NFkB1 ins/ins genotype were characterized by worse response to TNFi treatment (p = 0.023). In patients, before TNFi therapy, expression levels of miR-146a-5p were less (0.422 ?с 0.171) as compared to those detected after three months of treatment (1.809 ?с 0.658, p = 0.033) and observed for healthy controls (5.302 ?с 2.112, p = 0.048). Moreover, patients with higher circulating miR-146a-5p levels after three months of TNFi administration were more frequently carrying the rs2910164-C allele (p = 0.032). These results support the hypothesis that miR-146a might be involved in pathogenesis of RA and imply that miR-146a-3p polymorphism may be associated with miR-146a-5p levels in serum after anti-TNF-?с treatment.",2016,"['Alleles', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inflammation', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors']",28083614,hsa-mir-146a,no,
miR-4461 inhibits the progression of Gallbladder carcinoma via regulating EGFR/AKT signaling.,"Increasing evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) participated in the tumorigenesis, progression and recurrence of various malignancies including Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). miR-4461 was reported to work as a tumor suppressor gene in renal cell carcinoma. However, the role of miR-4461 in GBC remains unknown. Herein, we show that miR-4461 is downregulated in gallbladder cancer stem cells (CSCs). Forced miR-4461 expression attenuates the self-renewal, tumorigenicity of gallbladder CSCs, and inhibits proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells. Conversely, miR-4461 knockdown promotes the self-renewal of gallbladder CSCs, and facilities proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells. Mechanistically, miR-4461 inhibits GBC progression via downregulating EGFR/AKT pathway. Special EGFR siRNA or AKT overexpression virus abolishes the discrepancy of self-renewal, tumorigenesis, growth, and metastasis between miR-4461 overexpression GBC cells and their control cells.

An alternative microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of GADD45A by p53 in human non-small-cell lung cancer cells.,"GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible alpha), a stress response gene induced by genotoxic and nongenotoxic stresses, is implicated in various key processes, including the control of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. The expression of GADD45A is directly regulated by numerous transcription factors, with p53 being the most representative. Moreover, post-transcriptional regulation also plays a role in GADD45A expression. However, little is known about the regulatory effects of microRNAs (miRNAs) on GADD45A expression. As a potential tumour suppressor, miR-138 has pleiotropic biological functions in various cancers. We have previously reported p53-mediated activation of miR-138 in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. In this study, we found that miR-138 specifically targeted AGO2, which affects the stability and maturation of miR-130b. Decreased expression of miR-130b promoted the expression of GADD45A and resulted in the G2/M phase arrest and proliferation inhibition in human NSCLC cells. Our results suggested that p53 could alternatively upregulate GADD45A in human NSCLC cells through a post-transcriptional pathway in which miR-138 is involved.",2017 Aug 2,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Argonaute Proteins/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",28769054,hsa-mir-130b,yes,
CRISPR/Cas12a Coupling with Magnetic Nanoparticles and Cascaded Strand,"Exosomal MicroRNA-21 (miRNA-21, miR-21) is significantly up-regulated in blood samples of patients with lung cancer. Exosomal-derived miR-21 can be used as a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. This paper develops a fluorescent biosensor based on the combination of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), cascade strand displacement reaction (CSDR) and CRISPR/Cas12a to detect the exosomal miR-21 from lung cancer. The powerful separation performance of MNPs can eliminate the potential interference of matrix and reduce the background signal, which is very beneficial for the improvement of specificity and sensitivity. The CSDR can specifically transform one miR-21 into plenty of DNA which can specifically trigger the trans-cleavage nuclease activity of Cas12a, resulting in the cleavage of ssDNA bi-labeled with fluorescent and a quencher. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the developed fluorescence biosensor exhibited high sensitivity and specificity towards the determination of exosomal-derived miR-21 with a linear range from 10 to 1 ?? 10(5) fM and a low detection limit of about 0.89 fM. Most importantly, this method can be successfully applied to distinguish the exosomal miR-21 from the lung cancer patients and the healthy people.",2022,"['*Biosensing Techniques/methods', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Humans', '*Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', '*Magnetite Nanoparticles', '*MicroRNAs/genetics']",36014577,hsa-mir-21,no,
MicroRNA miR-497 is closely associated with poor prognosis in patients with,"Cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS) is the most common type of stroke, which is highly hazardous. This investigation aims to analyze the correlation of miR-497 with CIS, so as to provide reliable evidence for clinical response to CIS and lay a solid foundation for follow-up research. Eighty-nine CIS patients and 39 concurrent physical examinees selected between June 2017 and October 2018 were enrolled as the research participants. Additionally, SD rats with increased miR-497 expression and normal SD rats were purchased for CIS modeling to observe the clinical implications of miR-497 in CIS, as well as the water content of brain tissue and neuronal apoptosis of rats. miR-497 expression was lower in CIS patients than in physical examinees, and that in patients with complete stroke (CS) was the lowest, which increased after treatment. As determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, miR-497 had an outstanding diagnostic efficacy for CIS and was negatively correlated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and MDA concentration, while positively related to SOD concentration. Prognostic follow-up demonstrated that decreased miR-497 expression in patients after treatment predicted an increased risk of prognostic death and recurrence. However, observed in rats, the water content of the brain tissue of rats with increased miR-497 expression was reduced, and the neuronal apoptosis rate of the brain tissue was inhibited. Taken together, with low expression in CIS, miR-497 is strongly related to CIS progression and is a candidate CIS marker.",2021,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Brain/cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Ischemic Stroke/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",34152256,hsa-mir-497,no,
Detection of platelet microRNA expression in patients with diabetes mellitus with,"AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of plasma and platelet microRNAs in the occurrence of ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus. METHODS: miR-223, miR-146a, miR-495, and miR-107 expression in the plasma and platelets, blood glucose concentration, and platelet activation rate were measured in patients with diabetes mellitus and ischemic stroke, diabetes mellitus only, ischemic stroke only, and healthy controls. Platelet activity was measured by flow cytometric measurement of P-selectin expression, while miRNA was measured by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The expressions of platelet and plasma miR-223 and miR-146a were significantly downregulated in patients with ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus or diabetes mellitus only, but not in patients with ischemic stroke only compared to healthy controls. The expressions of platelet and plasma miR-495 and miR-107 showed no significant differences among these four groups. The expression of platelet miR-223 and miR-146a significantly correlated with plasma miR-223 and miR-146a levels, blood glucose concentration, and platelet activation rate. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia may downregulate the expressions of miR-223 and miR-146a, leading to subsequent platelet activation in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Functional role of microRNA-500a-3P-loaded liposomes in the treatment of cisplatin-induced AKI.,"Cisplatin treatment results in acute kidney injury (AKI) by the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). The knockout of MLKL, which is a principle mediator of necroptosis, is believed to alleviate the AKI symptoms. The present study was aimed to improve the therapeutic efficacy in AKI. For this purpose, miR-500a-3P was identified as appropriate miRNA therapeutics and loaded in liposome delivery carrier. The authors have showed that the miR-LIP directly controls the expression of RIPK3 and MLKL - a modulator of necroptosis and thereby reduces the severity of kidney injury. The miR-LIP significantly controlled the phosphorylation of MLKL compared to that of CDDP-treated HK2 cells. Similar results are observed with RIPK3. The miR-LIP has also been demonstrated to control the inflammatory response in tubular cells. Western blot analysis further revealed that the phosphorylation of P-65 was mainly responsible for the inflammatory response and miR-LIP significantly decreased the CDDP-induced NF-kB phosphorylation. Overall, the present study explored the molecular mechanism behind the necroptosis in AKI and potential of miRNA in targeting MLKL pathways.

Endocervical miRNA Expression Profiles in Women Positive for Chlamydia,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of sexually transmitted infections that may progress to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. No effective vaccine exists for Chlamydia, nor are there biomarkers available that readily predict disease progression. In this cross-sectional pilot study, we recruited symptomatic and asymptomatic women with C. trachomatis (CT) infection and asymptomatic, uninfected control women from an urban sexually transmitted disease clinic to determine if there were differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Infected women with signs and/or symptoms (CTSS) have distinct miRNA profiles compared to asymptomatic infected women (CTNS). In the CTSS group, miR-142 and -147 showed 2.2- to 6.9-fold increases in expression. In the CTNS group, miR-449c, -6779, -519d, -449a, and -2467 showed 3.9- to 9.0-fold increases in expression. In the CTNS group, cyclins and cell cycle regulation and IL-17 pathways were likely downregulated, while the same signaling pathways were upregulated in the CTSS group. In addition, in the CTSS group, additional inflammatory pathways associated with TNFR1 and IL-8 appear to be upregulated.

A six-microRNA panel in plasma was identified as a potential biomarker for lung,"Differently expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in the plasma of lung adenocarcinoma (LA) patients might serve as biomarkers for LA detection. MiRNA expression profiling was performed using Exiqon panels followed by the verification (30 LA VS. 10 healthy controls (HCs)) with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in the screening phase. Identified miRNAs were confirmed through training (42 LA VS. 32 HCs) and testing stages (66 LA VS. 62 HCs) by using qRT-PCR based absolute quantification methods. A total of six up-regulated plasma miRNAs (miR-19b-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-409-3p, miR-425-5p and miR-584-5p) were identified. The six-miRNA panel could discriminate LA patients from HCs with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72, 0.74 and 0.84 for the training, testing and the external validation stage (33 LA VS. 30 HCs), respectively.

Identification of Key Genes and miRNAs Affecting Osteosarcoma Based on Bioinformatics.,"METHODS: GSE70367 and GSE69470 were obtained from the GEO database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs were analyzed using the GEO2R tool and then visualized with R software. Moreover, the targets of the miRNAs in the DEGs were screened and then used for enrichment analysis. Besides, the STRING database and Cytoscape were applied to illustrate the protein-protein interaction network. RT-qPCR was performed to measure the expression of key genes and miRNAs. Western blot was applied to detect the signaling pathway. RESULTS: 9 upregulated genes and 39 downregulated genes in GSE69470 were identified as the DEGs, and 31 upregulated genes and 56 downregulated genes in GSE70367 were identified as the DEGs. Moreover, 21 common genes were found in the DEGs of GSE70367 and GSE69470. The enrichment analysis showed that the common DEGs of GSE70367 and GSE69470 were related with cell development, covalent chromatin modification, and histone modification and involve in the regulation of MAPK, mTOR, and AMPK pathways. Besides, the miRNAs including miR-543, miR-495-3p, miR-433-3p, miR-381-3p, miR-301a-3p, miR-199b-5p, and miR-125b-5p were identified as the biomarkers of osteosarcoma. In addition, the target genes including HSPA5, PPARG, MAPK14, RAB11A, RAB5A, MAPK8, LEF1, HIF1A, CAV1, GS3KB, FOXO3, IGF1, and NFKBIA were identified as hub nodes. It was found that miR-301a-3p expression was decreased and mRNA expression of RAB5A and NFKBIA was increased in the pathological tissues. The AKT-PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway was activated in pathological tissues.

Detection of microRNA as novel biomarkers of epithelial ovarian cancer from the,"OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA (miRNA) is an abundant class of small noncoding RNAs that act as gene regulators. Recent studies have suggested that miRNA deregulation is associated with the initiation and progression of human cancer. However, information about cancer-related miRNA is mostly limited to tissue miRNA. The aim of this study was to find specific profiles of serum-derived miRNAs of ovarian cancer based on a comparative study using a miRNA microarray of serum, tissue, and ascites. METHODS: From 2 ovarian cancer patients and a healthy control, total RNA was isolated from their serum, tissue, and ascites, respectively, and analyzed by a microarray. Under the comparative study of each miRNA microarray, we sorted out several miRNAs showing a consistent regulation tendency throughout all 3 specimens and the greatest range of alteration in serum as potential biomarkers. The availability of biomarkers was confirmed by qRT-PCR of 18 patients and 12 controls. RESULTS: Out of 2222 kinds of total miRNAs that were identified in the microarray analysis, 95 miRNAs were down-regulated and 88 miRNAs were up-regulated, in the serum, tissue, and ascites of cancer patients. Among the miRNAs that showed a consistent regulation tendency through all specimens and showed more than a 2-fold difference in serum, 5 miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, miR-145, and miR-143) were determined as the 5 most markedly down-regulated miRNAs in the serum from ovarian cancer patients with respect to those of controls. Four miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145) out of 5 selected miRNAs were significantly underexpressed in the serum of ovarian cancer patients in qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer. Also, serum miRNAs is a promising and useful tool for discriminating between controls and patients with serous ovarian cancer.",2013,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ascites/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*blood', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",23542579,hsa-let-7b,no,
Acute strength training promotes responses in whole blood circulating levels of,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) consists of a set of metabolic and endocrine disorders which evolve into deficiency in insulin action and hyperglycemia. Physical exercise is considered the main intervention to prevent and control T2DM. Literature has suggested that circulating microRNAs (miRs) help to understand responses to physical activity among diabetic patients. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the acute effect of two interventions (strength and cardiovascular) on the total, whole blood circulating concentrations of miR-126, miR-146a and miR-155 in older adults with and without T2DM. A total of 23 male and female older adults (68.2?с5.3 years) participated in the trial, 13 of whom presented with controlled T2DM and 10 were nondiabetics. They underwent both interventions separately, performed with intensity from 60% to 70% of reserve heart rate. Glucose and miRs levels were quantified and compared across groups with baseline titers as covariables. Diabetic patients showed more reduction in serum blood glucose than nondiabetics, with a great magnitude of reduction after the strength training intervention, which was paralleled by a positive change of the whole blood circulating levels of miR-146a, but not of the other miRs. Our report supports evidence that miR-146a levels in peripheral blood leukocytes are negatively associated with a state of insulin resistance, which is suggested as a novel marker to trace response to antidiabetic interventions.",2017,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Glucose', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolism/*rehabilitation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Insulin Resistance/physiology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Resistance Training/*methods']",28979106,hsa-mir-126,no,
"microRNA-935 is reduced in non-small cell lung cancer tissue, is linked to poor outcome, and acts on signal transduction mediator E2F7 and the AKT pathway.","BACKGROUND: A potential role for microRNA-935 (miR-935) has been identified in several cancers but not in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesised changes in miR-935 in NSCLC, and proposed mechanisms that may further explain its role in carcinogenesis. METHODS: NSCLC tissue and nearby normal tissue was obtained from 101 patients and was probed by qRT-PCR for miR-935 expression. The role of miR-935 and a potential target (signal transduction factor E2F7) was determined in cell lines by a dual luciferase assay. The function of miR-935 was investigated through metabolic activity (MTT) and transwell migration assays. Western blot and immunocytochemical assays examined protein expression level. Growth of miR-935 transfected or untransfected cells was measured via xenograft tumour formation. RESULTS: miR-935 was reduced in cancer tissue and was related to lymph node metastases, tumour node metastasis status and poor prognosis (all p < 0.02). In vitro, miR-935 suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion in NSCLC cells through targeting E2F7. Furthermore, E2F7 was upregulated in NSCLC tissue associated with poor prognosis (p = 0.0203) of NSCLC patients. miR-935 suppressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and AKT pathways in NSCLC and inhibited the tumour growth in vivo.

In Silico Identification of Human miR 3654 and its Targets Revealed its Involvement in Prostate Cancer Progression.,"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs known to control a broad range of biological functions such as cellular proliferation, differentiation and programmed cell death. Recent reports showed that miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, thereby, playing an important role in cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, we know that Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are random single pass sequence reads, which displays the condition/tissue specific transcripts (coding and non-coding) of an organism. METHODS: In the present study, we have applied the bioinformatics approach to identify miRNA from prostate cancer using EST resource and its expressions were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Analysis of transcriptomics resource from the LNCaP cells revealed the presence of an EST encoding hsa-miR-3654. Presence of the premature candidate of miR-3654, demonstrates its expression in LNCaP cells. We further indentified that the expression level (Fold Induction) of miR-3654 in LNCaP was higher than the normal and androgen insensitive prostate cancer cell lines (PNT1A, PC-3).

In the present study, we found that miR-532-5p was significantly downregulated in both OS tissues and cell lines. The low level of miR-532-5p was associated with advance clinical stage and poor overall survival in patient with OS. The functional experiments implied that upregulation of miR-532-5p restrained OS U2OS cell growth and metastatic ability in vitro; induced apoptosis, and impaired OS cell growth in vivo. Mechanistically, chemokine (C-X-C Motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2) was proved as a target gene of miR-532-5p. The inhibitory effects of miR-532-5p on OS cell were rescued by CXCL2 overexpression.

Cell transfer of information via miR-loaded exosomes: a biophysical approach.,"A new communication route among cells was reported in recent years, via extracellular vesicles and their cargo. Exosomes in particular are attracting increasing interest as privileged mediators of this cell communication route. The exosome-mediated transfer of nucleic acids, especially of microRNAs, is particularly promising for their use both as biomarkers of pathologies and as a therapeutic tool. Here, a simplified model of interaction among cells, microRNAs and vesicles is studied using a biophysical approach. A synthetic and fluorescent microRNA (i.e. miR-1246 conjugated with TAMRA) was selected to model cell communication, monitoring its internalization in cells. The fluorescent miR-1246, either naked or included in synthetic or natural vesicles, was incubated with human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7) for different times. A comparison between this human microRNA and its DNA copy or an exogenous microRNA (from Caenorhabditis elegans) allowed assessment of the specificity of the information transfer through microRNAs, and especially associated with exosomes. The uptake of naked miR-1246 was indeed higher both in terms of number of targeted cells and intensity of fluorescence signal with respect to the other nucleic acids tested. The same occurred with miR-1246 loaded exosomes, evidencing a specific uptake only partially due to the lipidic components and present only when the human microRNA was loaded in exosomes, which were themselves derived from the same MCF7 cells.",2017 Dec,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Communication', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism']",29043382,hsa-mir-1246,no,
MiR-615-3p inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of human lumbar ligamentum flavum cells via suppression of osteogenic regulators GDF5 and FOXO1.,"Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a disease of heterotopic ossification in spinal ligaments. The key of the OLF pathogenesis is the differentiation of fibroblasts into osteoblasts. In this study, we explored the role of miR-615-3p in the osteogenic differentiation of human LF cells. The expression of miR-615-3p was detected during the osteogenic differentiation of hFOB1.19 human osteoblasts, human BMSCs, and human LF cells. The qPCR results showed that miR-615-3p was being decreased during the osteogenic differentiation of these cell lineages. Then, both gain- and loss-function experiments, respectively performed by single-strand miR-615-3p mimic and antagomir, revealed that miR-615-3p negatively regulated the osteogenesis of hLF cells, manifested by a lighter staining degree with Alizarin Red and a decreased level of osteogenic marker genes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), RUNX2, osterix (ostx), osteocalcin (OCN), and osteopontin (OPN). Subsequently, our data on bioinformatic analysis, 3'-UTR luciferase activity assay, and protein level detection indicated that miR-615-3p directly targeted and suppressed the expression of FOXO1 and GDF5. Furthermore, knockdown of either FOXO1 or GDF5 could inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of hLF cells, which displayed a similar effect with the miR-615-3p mimic.

"miR-362-3p regulates cell proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblastic cells under hypoxia through targeting Pax3.","Preeclampsia (PE), a common obstetrical disorder, is one of the leading causes of pregnancy associated death. PE is closely linked with impaired migration and invasion ability of trophoblastic cells. miR-362-3p recently received our particular attention due not only to its aberrant expression in the placentas of patients with PE, but also to its important roles in regulating migration and invasion of various cells. This study was thus conducted to investigate the roles of miR-362-3p in PE and the related mechanism. The expression of miR-362-3p and Pax3 was examined in placentas of patients with PE and in normal placentas. HTR8/SVneo cells were cultured under hypoxia and transfected with miR-362-3p mimics, miR-362-3p inhibitors or Pax3 over-expression vectors. Results showed up-regulation of miR-362-3p but down-regulation of Pax3 in placentas of preeclamptic pregnancies. Luciferase report assay confirmed that Pax3 is a direct target of miR-362-3p. Although Pax3 was predicted to be targeted by miR-30a-3p and miR-181a-5p as well, their expression either had no difference between placentas of PE patients and normal placentas or showed less increment in placentas of PE patients than miR-362-3p. Exposure to hypoxia inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion of HTR8/SVneo cells. Increasing miR-362-3p by the mimics conferred improved effects on the inhibition. However, deletion of miR-362-3p or overexpression of Pax3 abolished the inhibiton.

Levels of microRNA miR-16 and miR-155 are altered in serum of patients with,"Identification of blood biomarkers that can be useful for predicting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.TB) infection, effect of therapy and Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB infected individuals is clinically useful for combating tuberculosis epidemic. In this study, we have evaluated the levels of selected miRNAs in serum of TB and MDR TB patients. In addition, we have studied their levels in serum of patients post-therapy. The levels of 4-miRNAs (miR-16, miR-29a, miR-125b and miR-155) were measured in 30 newly diagnosed TB patients, 19 Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB patients, 10 patients who completed TB therapy and were TB negative. 30 healthy individuals were recruited as controls. The levels of the miRNAs were estimated by qRT-PCR. Of the four miRNAs studied, the levels of miR-16 were significantly elevated and miR-155 were significantly reduced in serum of TB patients as compared to uninfected controls. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of miR-16 and miR-155 exhibited a significant distinguishing efficiency with an AUC value of 1 (95% CI, 1 to 1) and 0.967 (95% CI, 0.92-1.04) respectively. Following the therapy, the levels of miR-16 and miR-155 returned to those observed in healthy subjects. In patients with MDR TB, miR-155 was lower as compared to healthy controls and TB treated group but higher as compared to TB na??ve patients. miR-16 levels were lowest in serum of MDR TB patients compared to TB na??ve, TB treated group and healthy controls. In conclusion, miR-16 and miR-155 in serum may act as surrogate biomarker for studying TB infection, progression of therapy and MDR TB.",2017,"['Adult', 'Antitubercular Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Young Adult']",28061948,hsa-mir-29a,no,
Allosteric Inhibition of Ubiquitin-like Modifications by a Class of Inhibitor of,"Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) post-translational modifications are potential targets for therapeutics. However, the only known mechanism for inhibiting a Ubl-activating enzyme is through targeting its ATP-binding site. Here we identify an allosteric inhibitory site in the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-activating enzyme (E1). This site was unexpected because both it and analogous sites are deeply buried in all previously solved structures of E1s of ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubl). The inhibitor not only suppresses SUMO E1 activity, but also enhances its degradation in vivo, presumably due to a conformational change induced by the compound. In addition, the lead compound increased the expression of miR-34b and reduced c-Myc levels in lymphoma and colorectal cancer cell lines and a colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model. Identification of this first-in-class inhibitor of SUMO E1 is a major advance in modulating Ubl modifications for therapeutic aims.",2019,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Sumoylation/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",30581133,hsa-mir-34b,no,
Synergistic effect of MiR-146a mimic and cetuximab on hepatocellular carcinoma,"Previously, we found that the expression of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues compared to the adjacent noncancerous hepatic tissues. In the current study, we have explored the in vitro effect of miR-146a on the malignant phenotypes of HCC cells. MiR-146a mimic could suppress cell growth and increase cellular apoptosis in HCC cell lines HepG2, HepB3, and SNU449, as assessed by spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Furthermore, western blot showed that miR-146a mimic downregulated EGFR, ERK1/2, and stat5 signalings. These effects were less potent compared to that of a siRNA targeting EGFR, a known target gene of miR-146a. Moreover, miR-146a mimic could enhance the cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction impact of various EGFR targeting agents. The most potent combination was miR-146a mimic with cetuximab, presenting a synergistic effect. In conclusion, miR-146a plays a vital role in the cell growth and apoptosis of HCC cells and inducing miR-146a level might be a critical targeted molecular therapy strategy for HCC.",2014,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cetuximab', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",24895573,hsa-mir-146a,yes,
MiR-520b inhibits endothelial activation by targeting NF-kappaB p65-VCAM1 axis.,"MiR-520b belongs to the miR-373/520 family, is expressed only in human and nonhuman primates. Previous reports indicated that the expression of miR-520b was repressed in human atherosclerotic plaque tissue compared with healthy vessels. However, the role of miR-520b in coronary artery disease still remains to be uncovered. In this study, we demonstrated that endothelial cells (ECs) in human atherosclerotic plaques expressed miR-520b and aimed to elucidate the impact of miR-520b on EC activation and inflammatory response. To determine the potential targets of miR-520b, we performed RNA-seq analysis by transfecting miR-520b mimics in ECs. The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) validation suggested that miR-520b over-expression reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression (e.g. ICAM1, VCAM1, SELE) while the inhibition of miR-520b induced their expression. By combining bioinformatics prediction and functional assays, we identified that RELA (Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) Transcription Factor P65) was a direct target of miR-520b. Moreover, miR-520b mimics attenuated monocyte adhesion and monocyte trans-endothelial migration (the initial steps of atherosclerotic formation) in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulation. Re-expression of a non-miR-targetable version of p65 could rescue the reduced monocyte cell attachment, suggesting that this process is NF-kappaB p65 dependent. MiR-520b reduced the abundance of NF-kappaB p65 in cytoplasmic fractions without corresponding increase in nuclear fractions, indicating that this regulation is independent of p65 translocation process. MiR-520b mimics attenuated the activity of VCAM-1 promoter, whereas miR-520b inhibitor activated its activity. However, miR-520b inhibitor had no effect on promoter activity containing the mutated NF-kappaB p65 binding sites, strongly demonstrating that the impact of miR-520b on VCAM1 gene is mediated by NF-kappaB p65. Thus, we concluded that miR-520b suppressed EC inflammation and the cross-talk between monocytes and ECs by down-regulating NF-kappaB p65-ICAM1/VCAM1 axis and might serve as a potential therapeutic target for EC dysfunction and atherosclerosis.",2021 Jun,"['Atherosclerosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",33819467,hsa-mir-520b,yes,
Genome-wide miRNA profiling of mantle cell lymphoma reveals a distinct subgroup with poor prognosis.,"miRNA deregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Using a high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR platform, we performed miRNA profiling on cyclin D1-positive MCL (n = 30) and cyclin D1-negative MCL (n = 7) and compared them with small lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (n = 12), aggressive B-cell lymphomas (n = 138), normal B-cell subsets, and stromal cells. We identified a 19-miRNA classifier that included 6 up-regulated miRNAs and 13 down regulated miRNA that was able to distinguish MCL from other aggressive lymphomas. Some of the up-regulated miRNAs are highly expressed in naive B cells. This miRNA classifier showed consistent results in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and was able to distinguish cyclin D1-negative MCL from other lymphomas. A 26-miRNA classifier could distinguish MCL from small lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma, dominated by 23 up-regulated miRNAs in MCL. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of MCL patients demonstrated a cluster characterized by high expression of miRNAs from the polycistronic miR17-92 cluster and its paralogs, miR-106a-363 and miR-106b-25, and associated with high proliferation gene signature. The other clusters showed enrichment of stroma-associated miRNAs, and also had higher expression of stroma-associated genes. Our clinical outcome analysis in the present study suggested that miRNAs can serve as prognosticators.",2012 May 24,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/physiology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Validation Studies as Topic']",22490335,hsa-mir-106b,no,
