357,"Mature miRNAs form secondary structure, which suggests their function beyond","The generally accepted model of the miRNA-guided RNA down-regulation suggests that mature miRNA targets mRNA in a nucleotide sequence-specific manner. However, we have shown that the nucleotide sequence of miRNA is not the only determinant of miRNA specificity. Using specific nucleases, T1, V1 and S1 as well as NMR, UV/Vis and CD spectroscopies, we found that miR-21, miR-93 and miR-296 can adopt hairpin and/or homoduplex structures. The secondary structure of those miRNAs in solution is a function of RNA concentration and ionic conditions. Additionally, we have shown that a formation of miRNA hairpin is facilitated by cellular environment.Looking for functional consequences of this observation, we have perceived that structure of these miRNAs resemble RNA aptamers, short oligonucleotides forming a stable 3D structures with a high affinity and specificity for their targets. We compared structures of anti-tenascin C (anti-Tn-C) aptamers, which inhibit brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO IV) and selected miRNA. A strong overexpression of miR-21, miR-93 as well Tn-C in GBM may imply some connections between them. The structural similarity of these miRNA hairpins and anti-Tn-C aptamers indicates that miRNAs may function also beyond RISC and are even more sophisticated regulators, that it was previously expected. We think that the knowledge of the miRNA structure may give a new insight into miRNA-dependent gene regulation mechanism and be a step forward in the understanding their function and involvement in cancerogenesis. This may improve design process of anti-miRNA therapeutics.",2014,"['Base Sequence', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*chemistry/genetics', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",25423301,hsa-mir-21,No
3230,Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: Molecular Distinction by MicroRNA Profiling.,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a miscellaneous disease with a variety of histological variants, each with its own mutational profile, and clinical and prognostic characteristics. Identification of microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles represents an important benchmark for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological behavior of these unique PTC subtypes in order that they be better characterized. We considered a series of 35 PTC samples with a histological diagnosis of either hobnail (17 cases) or classical variant (nine cases) and with a specific BRAF p.K601E mutation (nine cases). We determined the overall miRNA expression profile with NanoString technology, and both quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization were used to confirm selected miRNAs. The miRNA signature was found to consistently differentiate specific histotypes and mutational profiles. In contrast to the BRAF p.K601E mutation and classic PTCs, three miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-146b-5p, and miR-205-5p) were substantially overexpressed in the hobnail variant. The current study found that different miRNA signature profiles were linked to unique histological variants and BRAF mutations in PTC. Further studies focusing on the downstream pathogenetic functions of mRNAs in thyroid neoplasms are warranted.",2022,"['*Carcinoma, Papillary/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/genetics', '*Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism']",35282462,hsa-mir-21,No
23,First Trimester Prediction of Preterm Delivery in the Absence of Other Pregnancy-Related Complications Using Cardiovascular-Disease Associated MicroRNA Biomarkers.,"The aim of the study was to determine if aberrant expression profile of cardiovascular disease associated microRNAs would be able to predict within 10 to 13 weeks of gestation preterm delivery such as spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in the absence of other pregnancy-related complications (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, or small for gestational age). In addition, we assessed if aberrant expression profile of cardiovascular disease associated microRNAs would be able to predict preterm delivery before and after 34 weeks of gestation. The retrospective study was performed within the period November 2012 to March 2020. Whole peripheral blood samples were collected from 6440 Caucasian individuals involving 41 PTB and 65 PPROM singleton pregnancies. A control group, 80 singleton term pregnancies, was selected on the base of equal sample storage time. Gene expression of 29 selected cardiovascular disease associated microRNAs was studied using real-time RT-PCR. Downregulation of miR-16-5p, miR-20b-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-26a-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-210-3p, miR-221-3p and miR-342-3p was observed in pregnancies with preterm delivery before 37 (</=36 + 6/7) weeks of gestation. Majority of downregulated microRNAs (miR-16-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-26a-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-210-3p, and miR-342-3p) was associated with preterm delivery occurring before 37 (</=36 + 6/7) weeks of gestation. The only miR-210-3p was downregulated in pregnancies with preterm delivery before 34 (</=33 + 6/7) weeks of gestation. The type of preterm delivery also had impact on microRNA gene expression profile. Downregulation of miR-24-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-210-3p was a common feature of PTB and PPROM pregnancies. Downregulation of miR-16-5p, miR-20b-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-221-3p, and miR-342-3p appeared just in PTB pregnancies. No microRNA was uniquely dysregulated in PPROM pregnancies. The combination of 12 microRNAs (miR-16-5p, miR-20b-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-26a-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-210-3p, and miR-342-3p, AUC 0.818, p &lt; 0.001, 74.53% sensitivity, 75.00% specificity, cut off &gt; 0.634) equally as the combination of 6 microRNAs (miR-16-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-210-3p, AUC 0.812, p &lt; 0.001, 70.75% sensitivity, 78.75% specificity, cut off &gt; 0.652) can predict preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestation in early stages of gestation in 52.83% pregnancies at 10.0% FPR.

167,MicroRNA expression in response to controlled exposure to diesel exhaust:,"BACKGROUND: Adverse health effects associated with diesel exhaust (DE) are thought to be mediated in part by oxidative stress, but the detailed mechanisms are largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and may respond to exposures such as DE. OBJECTIVES: We profiled peripheral blood cellular miRNAs in participants with mild asthma who were exposed to controlled DE with and without antioxidant supplementation. METHODS: Thirteen participants with asthma underwent controlled inhalation of filtered air and DE in a double-blinded, randomized crossover study of three conditions: a) DE plus placebo (DEP), b) filtered air plus placebo (FAP), or c) DE with N-acetylcysteine supplementation (DEN). Total cellular RNA was extracted from blood drawn before exposure and 6 hr after exposure for miRNA profiling by the NanoString nCounter assay. MiRNAs significantly associated with DEP exposure and a predicted target [nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2)] as well as antioxidant enzyme genes were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for validation, and we also assessed the ability of N-acetylcysteine supplementation to block the effect of DE on these specific miRNAs. 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was measured in plasma as a systemic oxidative stress marker. RESULTS: Expression of miR-21, miR-30e, miR-215, and miR-144 was significantly associated with DEP. The change in miR-144 was validated by RT-qPCR. NRF2 and its downstream antioxidant genes [glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)] were negatively associated with miR-144 levels. Increases in miR-144 and miR-21 were associated with plasma 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine 8-OHdG level and were blunted by antioxidant (i.e, DEN). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic miRNAs with plausible biological function are altered by acute moderate-dose DE exposure. Oxidative stress appears to mediate DE-associated changes in miR-144.",2013,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vehicle Emissions/*toxicity']",23584289,hsa-mir-215,No
270,Distinct expression of the neurotoxic microRNA family let-7 in the cerebrospinal,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs originally involved in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. We have shown in previous work that the miRNA let-7b can act as a signalling molecule for Toll-like receptor 7, thereby initiating innate immune pathways and apoptosis in the central nervous system. Here, we investigated whether different members of the miRNA family let-7, abundantly expressed in the brain, are released into the human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and whether quantitative differences in let-7 copies exist in neurodegenerative diseases. RNA isolated from CSF of patients with Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and from control patients with frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), major depressive episode (MDE) without clinical or neurobiological signs of AD, and healthy individuals, was reverse transcribed with primers against nine let-7 family members, and miRNAs were quantified and analyzed comparatively by quantitative PCR. let-7 miRNAs were present in CSF from patients with AD, FTLD, MDE, and healthy controls. However, the amount of individual let-7 miRNAs in the CSF varied substantially. CSF from AD patients contained higher amounts of let-7b and let-7e compared to healthy controls, while no differences were observed regarding the other let-7 miRNAs. No increase in let-7b and let-7e was detected in CSF from FTLD patients, while in CSF from MDE patients, let-7b and let-7e copy levels were elevated. In CSF from AD patients, let-7b and let-7e were associated with extracellular vesicles. let-7 family members present in the CSF mediated neurotoxicity in vitro, albeit to a variable extent. Taken together, neurotoxic let-7 miRNAs are differentially and specifically released in AD, but also in MDE patients. Thus, these miRNAs may mirror common neuropathological paths and by this serve to unscramble mechanisms of different neurodegenerative diseases.",2018,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*metabolism', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Female', 'Frontotemporal Dementia/cerebrospinal fluid', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Middle Aged']",30011310,hsa-let-7b,No
434,Monoallelic and biallelic deletions of 13q14.3 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia:,"Deletion of 13q14.3 (del(13q)) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and implies a favorable prognosis. We explored the feasibility of detecting del(13q) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for miR-15a and miR-16-1, whose loci are located in the deleted region. We analyzed 23 cases of B-CLL with monoallelic (10 cases) or biallelic del(13q) (5 cases) and used trisomy 12-positive CLL samples (n = 8) as control samples. As expected, miR-15a was expressed at significantly lower levels in monoallelic del(13qx1) samples compared with trisomy 12 control samples (P = .001). Biallelic del(13q) (del(13qx2)) samples showed further reduction of miR-15a levels compared with monoallelic del(13q) (del(13qx1)) (P = .009). In contrast, miR-16-1 expression levels were generally much lower and variable, with the highest levels detected in del(13qx1). Analyzed retrospectively, miR-15a levels differ among the del(13q) groups. However, only del(13qx2) miR-15a levels are reduced enough to determine the allelic status of an individual sample prospectively by real-time quantitative PCR.",2012,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",22431542,hsa-mir-15a,No
345,miRNA-223 promotes gastric cancer invasion and metastasis by targeting tumor,"Traditional research modes aim to find cancer-specific single therapeutic target. Recently, emerging evidence suggested that some micro-RNAs (miRNA) can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. miRNAs are single-stranded, small noncoding RNA genes that can regulate hundreds of downstream target genes. In this study, we evaluated the miRNA expression patterns in gastric carcinoma and the specific role of miR-223 in gastric cancer metastasis. miRNA expression signature was first analyzed by real-time PCR on 10 paired gastric carcinomas and confirmed in another 20 paired gastric carcinoma tissues. With the 2-fold expression difference as a cutoff level, we identified 22 differential expressed mature miRNAs. Sixteen miRNAs were upregulated in gastric carcinoma, including miR-223, miR-21, miR-23b, miR-222, miR-25, miR-23a, miR-221, miR-107, miR-103, miR-99a, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-92, miR-146a, miR-214 and miR-191, and six miRNAs were downregulated in gastric carcinoma, including let-7a, miR-126, miR-210, miR-181b, miR-197, and miR-30aa-5p. After examining these miRNAs in several human gastric originated cell lines, we found that miR-223 is overexpressed only in metastatic gastric cancer cells and stimulated nonmetastatic gastric cancer cells migration and invasion. Mechanistically, miR-223, induced by the transcription factor Twist, posttranscriptionally downregulates EPB41L3 expression by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated regions. Significantly, overexpression of miR-223 in primary gastric carcinomas is associated with poor metastasis-free survival. These findings indicate a new regulatory mode, namely, specific miRNA, which is activated by its upstream transcription factor, could suppress its direct targets and lead to tumor invasion and metastasis.",2011,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Carcinoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/*metabolism']",21628394,hsa-mir-23a,Yes
1135,Extracellular vesicle microRNAs contribute to Notch signaling pathway in T-cell,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive T-cell malignancy characterized by genotypically-defined and phenotypically divergent cell populations, governed by adaptive landscapes. Clonal expansions are associated to genetic and epigenetic events, and modulation of external stimuli that affect the hierarchical structure of subclones and support the dynamics of leukemic subsets. Recently, small extracellular vesicles (sEV) such as exosomes were also shown to play a role in leukemia. Here, by coupling miRNome, bulk and single cell transcriptome profiling, we found that T-ALL-secreted sEV contain NOTCH1-dependent microRNAs (EV-miRs), which control oncogenic pathways acting as autocrine stimuli and ultimately promoting the expansion/survival of highly proliferative cell subsets of human T-cell leukemias. Of interest, we found that NOTCH1-dependent EV-miRs mostly comprised members of miR-17-92a cluster and paralogues, which rescued in vitro the proliferation of T-ALL cells blocked by γ-secretase inhibitors (GSI) an regulated a network of genes characterizing patients with relapsed/refractory early T-cell progenitor (ETP) ALLs. All these findings suggest that NOTCH1 dependent EV-miRs may sustain the growth/survival of immunophenotypically defined cell populations, altering the cell heterogeneity and the dynamics of T-cell leukemias in response to conventional therapies.",2022,"['Humans', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Extracellular Vesicles/genetics/metabolism']",36550553,hsa-mir-17,No

Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which has been reported in several cancers, plays important roles in cancer progression. However, the microRNA regulatory mechanism on MMP2 expression remains unclear. In this study, we first detected MMP2 and microRNA-29a (miR-29a) expression in oral squamous carcinoma (OSCC) specimens, which showed that MMP2 was higher in OSCC cancer tissues than adjacent tissues but that miR-29a was lower in OSCC cancer tissues than adjacent tissues. Then, we confirmed that miR-29a, which directly targeted 3'-UTR of MMP2 gene, negatively regulated MMP2 expression by miR-29a transfection and luciferase reporter assay. Exogenous overexpression of miR-29a inhibited OSCC cell invasion and anti-apoptosis significantly in vitro. Whereas, knockdown of miR-29a promoted OSCC cell invasion and induced drug-resistance in vitro. This study suggests that miR-29a plays an inhibiting role in the progression of OSCC, which may be a potentially therapeutic approach in the future.",2014,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",24210072,hsa-mir-29a,Yes

However, the mechanism of miR-221/222 action involved in carcinogenesis has not been extensively studied. Here, we found that reduction of miR-221/222 inhibited cell proliferation and induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in human epithelial cancer cells (A549 lung cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells). Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-221/222 co-modulated the p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) expression by directly targeting the binding site within the 3'UTR. Together, these findings suggest that PUMA is a direct target of miR-221/222 that functions as an endogenous apoptosis regulator in these epithelial cancers.",2010,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",21042732,hsa-mir-221,Yes
89,Predictive value of 4-Hydroxyglutamate and miR-149-5p on eclampsia.,"This research aimed at exploring the predictive value of 4-Hydroxyglutamate and miR-149-5p on eclampsia. Preeclampsia patients admitted to our hospital (n = 204), with 112 mild patients and 92 severe patients. Thereinto, pregnant women who underwent physical examination were regarded as a normal group (NG) (n = 100). Serum 4-Hydroxyglutamate levels and miR-149-5p in each group were detected. The serum 4-Hydroxyglutamate level in pregnant women in the NG was markedly lower than that in preeclampsia, while the miR-149-5p level was higher (p = 0.001). The serum 4-Hydroxyglutamate level in severe preeclampsia was higher than that in mild preeclampsia, while the miR-149-5p level was lower (p = 0.001). Partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) of preeclampsia patients were lower than those of the NG, while Fibrinogen (Fib) was higher (p = 0.001). With the aggravation of the condition of patients, PT, APTT decreased and Fib index increased. In preeclampsia patients, serum 4-Hydroxyglutamate was negatively correlated with PT and APTT, positively correlated with Fib content (p < 0.001); serum miR-149-5p was dramatically positively correlated with PT and APTT, negatively correlated with Fib content (p < 0.001). 4-Hydroxyglutamate and miR-149-5p were relevant to the occurrence time of preeclampsia; 4-Hydroxyglutamate, miR-149-5p and their combination could be used for preeclampsia diagnosis. According to the situation of newborn, they were divided into good and poor groups. The 4-Hydroxyglutamate level in the good group was lower than that in the poor group, while the miR-149-5p level was higher. The adverse prognosis of preeclampsia patients was predicted by 4-Hydroxyglutamate and miR-149-5p. 4-Hydroxyglutamate is highly expressed in preeclampsia, while miR-149-5p is low.

160,beta-arrestin1-mediated acetylation of Gli1 regulates Hedgehog/Gli signaling and modulates self-renewal of SHH medulloblastoma cancer stem cells.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant Sonic Hedgehog/Gli (Hh/Gli) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of Sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB). Cancer stem cells (CSCs), thought to be largely responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance, dissemination and relapse, have been identified in SHH-MB. Since we previously demonstrated that Hh/Gli signaling controls CSCs features in SHH-MB and that in these tumors miR-326 is down regulated, here we investigated whether there is a functional link between Hh/Gli signaling and miR-326. METHODS: We evaluated beta-arrestin1 (Arrb1) and its intragenic miR-326 levels in CSCs derived from SHH-MB. Subsequently, we modulated the expression of Arrb1 and miR-326 in CSCs in order to gain insight into their biological role. We also analyzed the mechanism by which Arrb1 and miR-326 control Hh/Gli signaling and self-renewal, using luciferase and protein immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: Low levels of Arrb1 and miR-326 represent a feature of CSCs derived from SHH-MB. We observed that re-expression of Arrb1 and miR-326 inhibits Hh/Gli signaling pathway at multiple levels, which cause impaired proliferation and self-renewal, accompanied by down regulation of Nanog levels. In detail, miR-326 negatively regulates two components of the Hh/Gli pathway the receptor Smoothened (Smo) and the transcription factor Gli2, whereas Arrb1 suppresses the transcriptional activity of Gli1, by potentiating its p300-mediated acetylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify a new molecular mechanism involving miR-326 and Arrb1 as regulators of SHH-MB CSCs. Specifically, low levels of Arrb1 and miR-326 trigger and maintain Hh/Gli signaling and self-renewal.",2017 Jul 17,"['Cell Self Renewal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Medulloblastoma/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/*genetics', 'beta-Arrestin 1/*genetics']",28716052,hsa-mir-326,Yes
23,"Expression of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs in Human Trabecular Meshwork Cells Upon Mechanical Stretch.","PURPOSE: Intraocular pressure (IOP), the primary risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma, is determined by resistance to aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork (TM). IOP homeostasis relies on TM responses to mechanical stretch. To model the effects of elevated IOP on the TM, this study sought to identify coding and non-coding RNAs differentially expressed in response to mechanical stretch. METHODS: Monolayers of TM cells from non-glaucomatous donors (n = 5) were cultured in the presence or absence of 15% mechanical stretch, 1 cycle/second, for 24 hours using a computer-controlled Flexcell unit. We profiled mRNAs and lncRNAs with stranded total RNA sequencing and microRNA (miRNA) expression with NanoString-based miRNA assays. We used two-tailed paired t-tests for mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and the Bioconductor limma package for miRNAs. Gene ontology and pathway analyses were performed with WebGestalt. miRNA-mRNA interactions were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Integrative miRNA Target Finder software. Validation of differential expression was conducted using droplet digital PCR. RESULTS: We identified 219 mRNAs, 42 miRNAs, and 387 lncRNAs with differential expression in TM cells upon cyclic mechanical stretch. Pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment of genes involved in steroid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. We also identified several miRNA master regulators (miR-125a-5p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-1275) that regulate several mechanoresponsive genes.

15,LEF1-AS1 accelerates tumorigenesis in glioma by sponging miR-489-3p to enhance HIGD1A.,"Long non-coding (lncRNA) lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 antisense RNA 1 (LEF1-AS1) has been validated to be implicated in manifold cancers, whereas its function in glioma has not been understood thoroughly. Hence, in this study, we tested that LEF1-AS1 expression was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Besides, knockdown of LEF1-AS1 repressed cell proliferation while activated apoptosis in glioma cells in vitro, and also suppressed tumor growth in vivo. RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays affirmed that LEF1-AS1 could bind with miR-489-3p. In addition, miR-489-3p expression was downregulated in glioma cells. Moreover, miR-489-3p depletion partly offset LEF1-AS1 knockdown-mediated function on proliferation and apoptosis. Further, HIGD1A identified as the target gene of miR-489-3p was upregulated in glioma cells. HIGD1A silence could restrict the process of glioma. In rescue assays, upregulation of HIGD1A remedied the inhibitory impacts of LEF1-AS1 silence on glioma cell growth. In summary, our studies corroborated the regulatory mechanism of LEF1-AS1/miR-489-3p/HIGD1A axis in glioma, suggesting that targeting LEF1-AS1 might be a promising method for glioma therapy in the future.",2020 Aug 11,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glioma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics']",32826866,hsa-mir-489,Yes

The aim of this study is to investigate the use of miR-221 and miR-18a in stool samples as non-invasive biomarkers for CRC diagnosis. METHODS: A miRNA expression array containing 667 miRNAs was performed to identify miRNA dysregulation in CRC tissues. We focused on miR-221 and miR-18a, two significantly upregulated miRNAs which were subsequently verified in 40 pairs of CRC tissues and 595 stool samples (198 CRCs, 199 polyps and 198 normal controls). RESULTS: miR-221 and miR-18a were upregulated in the miRNA expression array. miR-221 and miR-18a levels were also significantly higher in 40 CRC tumours compared with their respective adjacent normal tissues. In stool samples, miR-221 and miR-18a showed a significant increasing trend from normal controls to late stages of CRC (P<0.0001). The levels of stool miR-221 and miR-18a were both significantly higher in subjects with stages I+II (miR-221: P<0.0001, miR-18a: P<0.0001) and stages III+IV of CRC (miR-221: P=0.0004, miR-18a: P<0.0001) compared with normal controls. The AUC of stool miR-221 and miR-18a were 0.73 and 0.67 for CRC patients as compared with normal controls, respectively. No significant differences in stool miR-221 and miR-18a levels were found between patients with proximal and distal CRCs.

14,MicroRNA-22: a Novel and Potent Biological Therapeutics in Neurological,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are regulatory RNAs with 18-25 nucleotides lengths involved in various biological processes. Some miRs, including miR-22, play an essential role in regulating neurological disorders. MiR-22 is a brain-enriched regulatory element involved in angiogenesis, energy supply, adjustment of ionic channels, and suppression of malignant cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This article discusses the protective and therapeutic effects of miR-22 on neurological diseases and injuries, including cerebral ischemia, neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, and brain malignancies. We also correlated miR-22 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), panic disorders, schizophrenia, neural tube defect (anencephaly), and traumatic brain injury.

1012,MicroRNA profiling in kidney in pigs fed ochratoxin A contaminated diet.,"OTA is a toxic metabolite produced by fungus belonging to Aspergillus and Penicillium genera. Kidney is the main target of this toxin; OTA is considered as one of the etiological factors at the origin of the human Balkan endemic nephropathy. microRNA are short non-coding transcrips (18-22 nucleotides in length) regulating key cellular processes. Various miRNAs have been established to play important roles in development of renal carcinoma and urothelial cancer. The objective of this study is to analyse the miRNA profiling in the kidney of piglets experimentally intoxicated with feed contaminated with OTA. Fifteen piglets (five pigs/group) were randomly distributed into 3 groups, fed normal diet (Group 1: control), or diets contaminated with OTA in two concentrations: 50 μg OTA/kg feed (Group 2: 50 μg OTA/kg feed) or 200 μg OTA/kg feed (Group 3: 200 μg OTA/kg feed) for 28 days. At the end of the experiment blood samples were taken for serological analyses. Animals from control group and 200 μg OTA/kg feed were sacrificed and kidney samples were taken for histological and molecular analyses. As resulted from molecular profiling study there are 8 miRNA differentially expressed in OTA kidney vs control kidney, in which five miRNA were overexpressed in the kidney of OTA intoxicated animals: miR-497 (FC = 6.34), miR-133a-3p (FC = 5.75), miR-423-3p (FC = 5.48), miR-34a (FC = 1.68), miR-542-3p (1.65) while three miRNA were downregulated: miR-421-3p (FC = -3.96); miR-490 (FC = -3.87); miR-9840-3p (FC = -2.13). The altered miRNAs as effect of OTA are strongly connected to the engine of cancer, disturbing nodal points in different pathways, as TP53 signalling.

68,Circulating miR-148b-3p and miR-27a-3p can be potential biomarkers for diagnosis,"BACKGROUND: In view of the growing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), detection of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in the early stages is necessary to reduce the risk of developing diabetes, prevent the progression of the disease, and dysfunction of different organs. Since miRNAs are involved in the initiation and progression of numerous pathogenic processes, including diabetes, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression of miR-148b-3p and miR-27a-3p in prediabetic and T2D patients and to evaluate the diagnostic potential of these miRNAs. METHODS: We evaluated the expression of miR-148b-3p and miR-27a-3p in the plasma of three groups: 20 prediabetic patients, 20 T2D patients, and 20 healthy controls. The biochemical parameters were determined by the auto-analyzer. The possible target genes of these miRNAs were identified using an in-silico approach. RESULTS: Our results showed that, as compared to the healthy controls, there was a significant up regulation and down regulation in the expression of miR-148b-3p and miR-27a-3p in the T2D patients, respectively. The results of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis also suggested that miR-148b-3p acted successfully in discriminating the prediabetic and diabetic patients from the control group. According to in-silico analysis, miRs influence biological pathways involved in T2DM development, such as insulin signaling. CONCLUSIONS: The miR148b-3p and miR-27a-3p expression levels were deregulated in diabetes and pre-diabetes. Furthermore, miR-148b-3p showed significant ability in discriminating between diabetic and healthy individuals, suggesting a potential diagnostic use of miR-148b-3p in the detection of T2D.",2022,"['Biomarkers', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs', '*Prediabetic State/diagnosis/genetics']",35978298,hsa-mir-27a,No
229,MicroRNA-143 and -205 expression in neosquamous esophageal epithelium following,"INTRODUCTION: Ablation of Barrett's esophagus using Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is usually followed by the formation of a neosquamous epithelium. Investigating simple columnar or stratified squamous epithelium associated cytokeratin and microRNA (miRNA) expression in neo-squamous epithelium could help determine the identity and stability of the neosquamous epithelium. METHODS: Nine patients underwent ablation of Barrett's esophagus with APC. Biopsies were collected from Barrett's esophagus mucosa and proximal normal squamous epithelium before ablation, and from neosquamous and normal squamous epithelium after ablation. Additional esophageal mucosal biopsies from ten nonrefluxing subjects were used as a reference. RNA was extracted and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of the cytokeratins CK-8 and CK-14 and the microRNAs miR-143 and miR-205. RESULTS: CK-8 and miR-143 expression were significantly higher in Barrett's esophagus mucosa, compared to neosquamous and normal squamous epithelium before and after APC, whereas miRNA-205 and CK-14 expression was significantly lower in Barrett's esophagus mucosa compared to all categories of squamous mucosa. The expression of CK-8, CK-14, miR-205, and miR-143 was similar between neosquamous epithelium compared to normal squamous epithelium in patients with Barrett's esophagus. Only miR-143 expression was significantly higher in neosquamous and normal squamous epithelium before and after APC compared to normal squamous epithelium from control subjects (p < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The expression levels of cytokeratins and miRNAs studied in post-ablation neosquamous epithelium and normal squamous epithelium in patients with Barrett's esophagus are similar. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, miR-143 expression is still elevated in both neosquamous mucosa, and the squamous mucosa above the metaplastic segment, suggesting that this mucosa may not be normal; i.e., it is different to that seen in subjects without Barrett's esophagus. miR-143 could promote a Barrett's epithelium gene expression pattern, and this could have a role in development of Barrett's esophagus.",2009,"['Barrett Esophagus/genetics/pathology/*surgery', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Keratin-14/genetics/*metabolism', 'Keratin-8/genetics/*metabolism', '*Laser Coagulation', 'Lasers, Gas/therapeutic use', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mucous Membrane/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Regeneration/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",19190970,hsa-mir-143,No
90,Tissue and serum microRNA profile of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.,"Head and neck cancer is characterized by malignant tumors arising from the epithelium covering the upper aerodigestive tract, and the majority of these epithelial malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the oral cavity (OSCCs). The aim of the current work was to identify miRNAs regulated in OSCC cancerous tissue when compared to a healthy adjacent tissue and to verify the presence of the same miRNAs in the circulation of these patients. For that serum samples and biopsies of healthy and tumor tissues were collected from five patients diagnosed with OSCC of the oral cavity, RNA was extracted from these samples and microRNAs libraries were prepared and sequenced. A total 255 miRNAs were identified in tissue and 381 different miRNAs were identified in serum samples. When comparing the miRNA expression between tumor and healthy tissue we identified 48 miRNAs (25 down- and 23 up-regulated) that were differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05). From these 48 differentially expressed miRNAs in tissue, 30 miRNAs were also found in the serum of the same patients. hsa-miR-32-5p was up-regulated in tumor compared to healthy tissue in our study, and was previously shown to be up-regulated in the serum of OSCC patients.

439,MicroRNA 34a contributes to virus-mediated apoptosis through binding to its,"OBJECTIVE: Influenza A virus is a cytolytic virus that induces apoptosis in numerous cell types. However, molecular mechanism of cell apoptosis induced by influenza A virus is not well understood. The present study was aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of miR-34a involved in influenza A virus induced apoptosis. METHODS: Firstly, microRNA array was used to select miRNAs involved in influenza A virus infection. Then, Luciferase reporter assay and western blot were carried to determine the target gene of miR-34a. Finally, miR-34a mimic was transfected in influenza A virus-infected A549 cells, and western blot was used to test the function of miR-34a and its target gene in in influenza A virus infection. RESULTS: miR-34a was found significantly down-regulated in influenza A virus-infected A549 cells and was further confirmed by qRT-PCR in vitro and in vivo (P<0.01). Next, transfection miR-34 mimic/inhibitor in influenza A virus-infected A549 cells showed that overexpression of miR-34a could inhibit influenza virus-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, target prediction analysis revealed that miR-34a complemented to the 3'-UTR of Bax mRNA. Luciferase reporter assay and western blot confirm that miR-34a directly targeted Bax. Moreover, we detected influenza virus infection enhanced the luciferase reporter translational activity in A549 cells transfected with the construct with Bax 3'-UTR encoding miR-34a binding site. However, western blot analysis showed that the up-regulation of Bax protein level was significantly reversed by overexpression miR-34a. CONCLUSION: It is, therefore, concluded that influenza virus infection regulated pro-apoptotic Bax expression through miR-34a downregulation, which might be the partial mechanism of influenza virus-induced cell apoptosis.",2016,"['A549 Cells', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Influenza, Human/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/administration & dosage/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Young Adult', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",27610823,hsa-mir-34a,Yes
1724,Diagnostic value of the candidate microRNAs in thyroid fine-needle aspiration,"Background Thyroid cancer (TC) is known to be the most common endocrine malignancy with an incidence rate which has increased by 2.3-fold over the past 30 years. Approximately, 30% of the thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) outcomes are indecisive. Moreover, researchers recognized multiple differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) as candidate diagnostic markers for thyroid nodules. The purpose of this study was to identify thyroid tumor-associated miRNAs in FNAB with the capacity to be developed as unique biomarkers. Materials and methods According to the study design, a quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to evaluate the expression levels of nine miRNAs (Let7, miR-34a, miR-146b, miR-221, miR-151, miR-155, miR-181b, miR-222 and miR-375) among 224 FNA samples as the training set. Results The findings of this study revealed that miR-181b and miR-146b are the best predictors to diagnose benign thyroid FNA samples from malignant samples. However, the remaining miRNAs were co-expressed and had no significant effect on the predictor model. On the other hand, sensitivity and specificity of miR-181b and miR-146b were reported at 83.0%-83.0% and 83.0%-66.0%, respectively. Conclusions According to the results of this study, miR-146b and miR-181b might be considered as adjunct markers contributing to thyroid FNAB in tumor types. In addition, miR-146b and miR-181b were recognized as biomarkers for discriminating benign thyroid nodules from malignant ones.

30,miR-27b-5p inhibits BeWo cells fusion by regulating WNT2B and enzyme involved in,"PROBLEM: The miRNAs show placenta-specific expression patterns, which alter during pregnancy-related complications. In present study, the role of miR-27b-5p during forskolin-mediated BeWo cells fusion has been investigated. METHOD OF STUDY: The fusion of BeWo cells in response to forskolin treatment (25 µM) was studied by desmoplakin I+II staining. Expression profile of miR-27b-5p by qRT-PCR and its targets HSD3β1 and WNT2B by qRT-PCR and in Western blot were studied. The effect of overexpression of miR-27b-5p and silencing of HSD3β1 & WNT2B by siRNA on forskolin-mediated BeWo cells fusion and secretion of hCG and progesterone by ELISA was investigated. RESULTS: Time-dependent down-regulation in the expression of miR-27b-5p in forskolin-treated BeWo cells has been confirmed by qRT-PCR. Overexpression of miR-27b-5p significantly inhibits forskolin-mediated BeWo cells fusion as well as hCG & progesterone secretion. HSD3β1 and WNT2B were identified as targets of miR-27b-5p and are up-regulated in forskolin-treated BeWo cells. Overexpression of miR-27b-5p in BeWo cells downregulates their expression. Further, luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-27b-5p directly target expression of both HSD3β1 and WNT2B. Silencing of both HSD3β1 and WNT2B leads to a significant reduction in forskolin-mediated BeWo cells fusion with concomitant decrease in the secretion of progesterone or/and hCG. Decrease in forskolin-mediated cells fusion observed in miR-27b-5p mimic transfected BeWo cells could be rescued by the overexpression of both HSD3β1 and WNT2B. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that reduced miR-27b-5p in forskolin-treated BeWo cells leads to increased secretion of progesterone and hCG due to loss of repressional control on HSD3β1 and WNT2B.",2021,"['Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/*biosynthesis', 'Progesterone Reductase/*metabolism', 'Steroid Isomerases/*metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",33639023,hsa-mir-27b,Yes

They are needed to maintain cell homeostasis and signaling, which is possible due to defense systems. Disruption of this balance leads to oxidative stress that can induce cancer. Redox regulation by miRNAs may be a potential therapeutic target. The aim of the study was to assess the activity of genes associated with oxidative stress in endometrial cancer and to determine their relationship with miRNAs. The study included 45 patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer and 45 without neoplastic changes. The expression profile of genes associated with oxidative stress was determined with mRNA microarrays, RT-qPCR and ELISA. The miRNA prediction was performed based on the miRNA microarray experiment and the mirDB tool. PRDX2 and AQP1 showed overexpression that was probably not related to miRNA activity. A high level of PKD2 may be the result of a decrease in the activity of miR-195-3p, miR-20a, miR-134. A SOD3 level reduction can be caused by miR-328, miR-363.

40,circPVT1 regulates medullary thyroid cancer growth and metastasis by targeting miR-455-5p to activate CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) represents 13.4 % of all thyroid cancers-related deaths. The treatments for MTC are very limited especially for patients with distal metastasis. Therefore, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of MTC to pursue novel therapeutic avenues. Here, we studied the function of circPVT1/miR-455-5p in MTC. METHODS: Human MTC tissues and cell lines were used. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were employed to measure expression levels of miR-455-5p, circPVT1, CXCL12, and epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT)-related proteins. Colony formation assay, flow cytometry, transwell assay, and scratch wound healing assay were used to assess the abilities of cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, respectively. Dual luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation were employed to validate interactions of circPVT1/miR-455-5p and miR-455-5p/CXCL12. Nude mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the effects of shcircPVT1 and miR-455-5p mimics on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. RESULTS: miR-455-5p was reduced in MTC tissues and cells while circPVT1 was elevated. Their levels were correlated with prognosis of MTC. Overexpression of miR-455-5p or sh-circPVT1 suppressed EMT and MTC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. miR-455-5p targeted CXCL12 while circPVT1 sponged miR-455-5p. Knockdown of CXCL12 or CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling inhibitor reversed the effects of circPVT1 overexpression or miR-455-5p inhibitor on EMT and MTC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Knockdown of circPVT1 or miR-455-5p overexpression repressed MTC tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo.

1490,Role of miR-155 in the regulation of MMP-16 expression in intervertebral disc,"The molecular mechanisms of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) remain elusive. We found that miR-155 is down-regulated in degenerative nucleus pulposus (NP), and more severe degeneration is correlated with higher matrix metallopeptidase 16 (MMP-16) expression. MMP-16 also degraded matrix aggrecan. Here, we addressed the in vivo miR-155-mediated pathological impact on IDD using a classic puncture mouse model. Lentiviral upregulated-miR-155 or downregulated-miR-155 was transduced into the discs of C57 mice, which was validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting revealed that up-regulation of miR-155 resulted in down-regulation of MMP-16 and an increase in aggrecan and collagen type II in mouse NP; whereas, down-regulation of miR-155 resulted in up-regulation of MMP-16 and a decrease in aggrecan in mouse NP. Radiographic and histological analysis showed that the up-regulation of miR-155 attenuated IDD, while down-regulation of miR-155 resulted in the deterioration of IDD. These findings indicate that decreased miR-155 contributed to the up-regulation of MMP-16 in vivo, and MMP-16 further degraded aggrecan and collagen type II, leading to the dehydration and degeneration of discs. Our findings revealed a therapeutic role for miR-155 in IDD. © 2017 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Orthopaedic Research Society.

2019,Identification of Circulating Serum miRNAs as Novel Biomarkers in Pancreatic,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is difficult to detect in the early stages; thus, identifying specific and sensitive biomarkers for PC diagnosis is crucial, especially in the case of early-stage tumors. Circulating microRNAs are promising non-invasive biomarkers. Therefore, we aimed to identify non-invasive miRNA biomarkers and build a model for PC diagnosis. For the training model, blood serum samples from 63 PC patients and 63 control subjects were used. We selected 39 miRNA markers using a smoothly clipped absolute deviation-based penalized support vector machine and built a PC diagnosis model. From the double cross-validation, the average test AUC was 0.98. We validated the diagnosis model using independent samples from 25 PC patients and 81 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and compared the results with those obtained from the diagnosis using carbohydrate antigen 19-9. For the markers miR-155-5p, miR-4284, miR-346, miR-7145-5p, miR-5100, miR-661, miR-22-3p, miR-4486, let-7b-5p, and miR-4703-5p, we conducted quantitative reverse transcription PCR using samples from 17 independent PC patients, 8 ICC patients, and 8 healthy individuals. Differential expression was observed in samples from PC patients. The diagnosis model based on the identified markers showed high sensitivity and specificity for PC detection and is potentially useful for early PC diagnosis.",2021,"['Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*genetics/standards', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/blood/*genetics', 'Circulating MicroRNA/blood/*genetics/standards', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/blood/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",33498271,hsa-mir-155,No

680,Soy Isoflavone Genistein Impedes Cancer Stemness and Mesenchymal Transition in,"Genistein, a soy-derived phytoestrogen, has been shown to exhibit anti-neoplastic activities in various cancers. Nevertheless, its effects on the elimination of tumor-initiating cells of head and neck cancer (HNC-TICs) remain unclear. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effect of genistein on HNC-TICs and potential mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that genistein lowered the proliferation of HNC-TICs by examining the percentage of ALDH1+ or CD44+ cells. Aside from the downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HNC-TICs, genistein restricted their tumor propagating capacities in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, genistein potentiated cell death caused by three commonly used chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU). Our findings proved that genistein induced ROS production through upregulation of miR-34a, leading to apoptosis in HNC-TICs. The genistein-elicited miR-34a reduced self-renewal, migration, invasion capacities and ALDH1 activity, which may be partly owing to the repression of EMT. Furthermore, we showed that RTCB was a novel target that was negatively regulated by miR-34a and involved in the tumor repressive effect of genistein. Besides, the in vivo study validated that genistein retarded tumor growth through the elevation of miR-34a and suppression of RTCB. These results suggested that genistein-induced miR-34a contributed to the ROS-associated apoptosis and diminished stemness properties via repression of RTCB in HNC-TICs.",2020,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",32610494,hsa-mir-34a,Yes
190,The long noncoding RNA LINC01140/miR-140-5p/FGF9 axis modulates bladder cancer,"MIBC (muscle invasive bladder cancer) only accounts for only a minority of bladder cancers, however, the disease-specific and overall survival rates of patients with MIBC are low. Macrophage M2 polarization has been reported to be associated with poorer prognosis in bladder cancer. Through cancer bioinformatics and experimental analyses, FGF9 was found to be upregulated in MIBC tissues. FGF9 knockdown in T24 cells strongly suppressed the viability, migratory capacity, and invasive capacity of cells; culture with medium from FGF9 knockdown T24 cells (si-FGF9-CM) significantly inhibited macrophage M2 polarization, while promoting M1 polarization. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01140 was positively correlated with FGF9 and was significantly upregulated in MIBC tissues. LINC01140 knockdown inhibited the viability, migratory capacity and invasive capacity of T24 cells; culture in si-LINC01140-CM also inhibited macrophage M2 polarization, while promoting M1 polarization. LINC01140 targeted miR-140-5p, while miR-140-5p targeted FGF9 to form a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis. The effects of miR-140-5p inhibition on bladder cancer aggressiveness and macrophage M2 polarization were opposite to those of LINC01140 or FGF9 knockdown; additionally, miR-140-5p inhibition partially reversed the effects of LINC01140 knockdown on FGF9 protein levels, bladder cancer phenotype, and macrophage M2 polarization. In conclusion, LINC01140, miR-140-5p, and FGF9 form a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis that modulates the bladder cancer phenotype, affects macrophage M2 polarization through the tumor microenvironment, and in turn affects bladder cancer cell aggressiveness.",2020,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 9/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle, Smooth/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics', 'Tumor-Associated Macrophages/*immunology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Young Adult']",33234721,hsa-mir-140,Yes
3,Identification and functional analysis of a three-miRNA ceRNA network in hypertrophic scars.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic scar (HTS) is a fibrotic disorder of skins and may have repercussions on the appearance as well as functions of patients. Recent studies related have shown that competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks centering around miRNAs may play an influential role in HTS formation. This study aimed to construct and validate a three-miRNA (miR-422a, miR-2116-3p, and miR-3187-3p) ceRNA network, and explore its potential functions. METHODS: Quantitative real‑time PCR (qRT‑PCR) was used to compare expression levels of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and genes between HTS and normal skin. Target lncRNAs and genes of each miRNA were predicted using starBase as well as TargetScan database to construct a distinct ceRNA network; overlapping target lncRNAs and genes of the three miRNAs were utilized to develop a three-miRNA ceRNA network. For every network, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was performed to identify its hub genes. For each network and its hub genes, Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were conducted to explore their possible functions. RESULTS: MiR-422a, miR-2116-3p, and miR-3187-3p were all downregulated in HTS tissues and fibroblasts. MiR-422a-based ceRNA network consisted of 101 lncRNAs with 133 genes; miR-2116-3p-centered ceRNA network comprised 85 lncRNAs and 978 genes; miR-3187-3p-derived ceRNA network encompassed 84 lncRNAs as well as 1128 genes. The three-miRNA ceRNA network included 2 lncRNAs with 9 genes, where MAPK1, FOSL2, ABI2, KPNA6, CBL, lncRNA-KCNQ1OT1, and lncRNA-EBLN3P were upregulated. According to GO and KEGG analysis, these networks were consistently related to ubiquitination. Three ubiquitination-related genes (CBL, SMURF2, and USP4) were upregulated and negatively correlated with the expression levels of the three miRNAs in HTS tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a three-miRNA ceRNA network, which might take part in HTS formation and correlate with ubiquitination.",2021 Oct 29,"['*Cicatrix, Hypertrophic/genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', '*RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases']",34715879,hsa-mir-3187,No
1485,MicroRNA signature refine response prediction in CML.,"microRNAs (miRs) dysregulation have emerged as a crucial step in tumorigenesis, being related with cancer development, progression and response to treatment. In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is responsible for treatment failure and could be linked to changes in miRs expression. This work aimed to correlate the expression levels of 3 miRs, miR-21, miR-26b and miR-451, with response to TKI treatment in CML patients. miR-451 levels at diagnosis were significantly higher in patients with optimal response after 6 and 12 months of therapy. Conversely, patients without optimal response had highest levels of miR-21. miR-21 and miR-451 appear to be good biomarkers of response, able to predict optimal TKI responders (p < 0.05). Using the combined profile of both miRs, we create a predictive model of optimal response after one year of treatment. This study highlights the role of miR-21 and miR-451 expression levels at diagnosis in predicting which patients achieve the optimal response.",2019,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics/pathology', 'Disease Progression', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",31273251,hsa-mir-21,No
236,MicroRNA expression abnormalities in pancreatic endocrine and acinar tumors are,"PURPOSE: We investigated the global microRNA expression patterns in normal pancreas, pancreatic endocrine tumors and acinar carcinomas to evaluate their involvement in transformation and malignant progression of these tumor types. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting specific mRNAs for degradation or translation inhibition. Recent evidence indicates that microRNAs can contribute to tumor development and progression and may have diagnostic and prognostic value in several human malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a custom microarray, we studied the global microRNA expression in 12 nontumor pancreas and 44 pancreatic primary tumors, including 12 insulinomas, 28 nonfunctioning endocrine tumors, and four acinar carcinomas. RESULTS: Our data showed that a common pattern of microRNA expression distinguishes any tumor type from normal pancreas, suggesting that this set of microRNAs might be involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis; the expression of miR-103 and miR-107, associated with lack of expression of miR-155, discriminates tumors from normal; a set of 10 microRNAs distinguishes endocrine from acinar tumors and is possibly associated with either normal endocrine differentiation or endocrine tumorigenesis; miR-204 is primarily expressed in insulinomas and correlates with immunohistochemical expression of insulin; and the overexpression of miR-21 is strongly associated with both a high Ki67 proliferation index and presence of liver metastasis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that alteration in microRNA expression is related to endocrine and acinar neoplastic transformation and progression of malignancy, and might prove useful in distinguishing tumors with different clinical behavior.",2006,"['Carcinoma, Acinar Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Insulinoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Pancreas/metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival']",16966691,hsa-mir-107,No

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and potential role of miRNAs in vitiligo. Of 12 studied miRNAs with proven functions in cell proliferation, differentiation, immune responses and melanogenesis, miR-99b, miR-125b, miR-155 and miR-199a-3p were found to be increased and miR-145 was found to be decreased in the skin of patients with vitiligo. Combined pathway and target analysis revealed melanogenesis-associated targets for miR-99b, miR-125b, miR-155 and miR-199a-3p. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated increased expression of miR-155 in the epidermis of patients with vitiligo. Correspondingly, miR-155 was induced by vitiligo-associated cytokines in human primary melanocytes and keratinocytes. When overexpressed, miR-155 inhibited the expression of melanogenesis-associated genes and altered interferon-regulated genes in melanocytes and keratinocytes. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the expression of miRNAs is dysregulated in the skin of patients with vitiligo and suggests that miR-155 contributes to the pathogenesis of vitiligo.",2016,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Keratinocytes/*metabolism', 'Melanocytes/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vitiligo/*metabolism/pathology']",26941046,hsa-mir-145,No
648,MicroRNA-155 targets SMAD2 and modulates the response of macrophages to,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine with important effects on processes such as fibrosis, angiogenesis, and immunosupression. Using bioinformatics, we identified SMAD2, one of the mediators of TGF-β signaling, as a predicted target for a microRNA, microRNA-155 (miR-155). MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that have emerged as an important class of gene expression regulators. miR-155 has been found to be involved in the regulation of the immune response in myeloid cells. Here, we provide direct evidence of binding of miR-155 to a predicted binding site and the ability of miR-155 to repress SMAD2 protein expression. We employed a lentivirally transduced monocyte cell line (THP1-155) containing an inducible miR-155 transgene to show that endogenous levels of SMAD2 protein were decreased after sustained overexpression of miR-155. This decrease in SMAD2 led to a reduction in both TGF-β-induced SMAD-2 phosphorylation and SMAD-2-dependent activation of the expression of the CAGA(12)LUC reporter plasmid. Overexpression of miR-155 altered the cellular responses to TGF-β by changing the expression of a set of genes that is involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Our study provides firm evidence of a role for miR-155 in directly repressing SMAD2 expression, and our results demonstrate the relevance of one of the two predicted target sites in SMAD2 3'-UTR. Altogether, our data uncover an important role for miR-155 in modulating the cellular response to TGF-β with possible implications in several human diseases where homeostasis of TGF-β might be altered.",2010,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Fibrosis/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Smad2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Transgenes']",21036908,hsa-mir-155,Yes
2,Untargeted sequencing of circulating microRNAs in a healthy and diseased older population.,"We performed untargeted profiling of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in a well characterized cohort of older adults to verify associations of health and disease-related biomarkers with systemic miRNA expression. Differential expression analysis revealed 30 miRNAs that significantly differed between healthy active, healthy sedentary and sedentary cardiovascular risk patients. Increased expression of miRNAs miR-193b-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-885-3p, miR-193a-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-505-3p, miR-194-5p, miR-27b-3p, miR-885-5p, miR-23b-5b, miR-365a-3p, miR-365b-3p, miR-22-5p was associated with a higher metabolic risk profile, unfavourable macro- and microvascular health, lower physical activity (PA) as well as cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels. Increased expression of miR-342-3p, miR-1-3p, miR-92b-5p, miR-454-3p, miR-190a-5p and miR-375-3p was associated with a lower metabolic risk profile, favourable macro- and microvascular health as well as higher PA and CRF. Of note, the first two principal components explained as much as 20% and 11% of the data variance. miRNAs and their potential target genes appear to mediate disease- and health-related physiological and pathophysiological adaptations that need to be validated and supported by further downstream analysis in future studies.Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02796976 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02796976 ).",2022 Feb 22,"['Adaptation, Physiological/genetics', 'Age Factors', 'Cardiorespiratory Fitness', 'Circulating MicroRNA/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease/*genetics', 'Exercise/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Healthy Volunteers', 'Heart Disease Risk Factors', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sedentary Behavior']",35194110,hsa-mir-505,No
75,MiRNAs from DLK1-DIO3 Imprinted Locus at 14q32 are Associated with Multiple Sclerosis: Gender-Specific Expression and Regulation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Signaling.,"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most prevalent course of multiple sclerosis. It is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. To investigate the gender-specific involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in RRMS pathogenesis, we compared miRNA profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells separately in men and women (eight RRMS patients versus four healthy controls of each gender) using high-throughput sequencing. In contrast to women, six downregulated and 26 upregulated miRNAs (p(ad)(j) < 0.05) were identified in men with RRMS. Genes encoding upregulated miRNAs are co-localized in DLK1-DIO3 imprinted locus on human chromosome 14q32. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis was performed in independent groups of men (16 RRMS patients and 10 healthy controls) and women (20 RRMS patients and 10 healthy controls). Increased expression of miR-431, miR-127-3p, miR-379, miR-376c, miR-381, miR-410 and miR-656 was again demonstrated in male (p(ad)(j) < 0.05), but not in female RRMS patients. At the same time, the expression levels of these miRNAs were lower in healthy men than in healthy women, whereas in RRMS men they increased and reached or exceeded levels in RRMS women. In general, we demonstrated that expression levels of these miRNAs depend both on ""health(-)disease"" status and gender. Network-based enrichment analysis identified that receptor tyrosine kinases-activated pathways were enriched with products of genes targeted by miRNAs from DLK1-DIO3 locus. These results suggest the male-specific involvement of these miRNAs in RRMS pathogenesis via regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling.",2019 Feb 8,"['Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genetic Loci', '*Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Iodide Peroxidase/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction']",30743997,hsa-mir-381,No
105,MiR-137 inhibited cell proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle,"Abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown the great impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) on the cell proliferation of VSMCs. This study examined the effects of miR-137 on the cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs and also explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. The mRNA and protein expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot assays, respectively. The CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay and transwell migration assay were performed to measure cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs. The miR-137-targeted 3'untranslated region of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Platelet-derived growth factor-bb (PDGF-bb) treatment enhanced cell proliferation and suppressed the expression of miR-137 in VSMCs. The gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays showed that overexpression of miR-137 suppressed the cell proliferation and migration, and also inhibited the expression of matrix genes of VSMCs; down-regulation of miR-137 had the opposite effects on VSMCs. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase report assay results showed that IGFBP-5 was a direct target of miR-137, and miR-137 overexpression suppressed the IGFBP-5 expression and down-regulation of miR-137 increased the IGFBP-5 expression in VSMCs. PDGF-bb treatment also increased the IGFBP-5 mRNA expression. In addition, enforced expression of IGFBP-5 reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-137 on cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs. More importantly, overexpression of miR-137 also suppressed the activity of mTOR/STAT3 signaling in VSMCs. Taken together, the results suggest that miR-137 may suppress cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs via targeting IGFBP-5 and modulating mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway.",2017,"['Aorta/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Becaplermin', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Computational Biology', 'Diffusion Chambers, Culture', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5/*genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism']",29016699,hsa-mir-137,No
109,Aberrant overexpression and function of the miR-17-92 cluster in MLL-rearranged,"MicroRNA (miRNA)-17-92 cluster (miR-17-92), containing seven individual miRNAs, is frequently amplified and overexpressed in lymphomas and various solid tumors. We have found that it is also frequently amplified and the miRNAs are aberrantly overexpressed in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged acute leukemias. Furthermore, we show that MLL fusions exhibit a much stronger direct binding to the locus of this miRNA cluster than does wild-type MLL; these changes are associated with elevated levels of histone H3 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation and an up-regulation of these miRNAs. We further observe that forced expression of this miRNA cluster increases proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of human cells. More importantly, we show that this miRNA cluster can significantly increase colony-forming capacity of normal mouse bone marrow progenitor cells alone and, particularly, in cooperation with MLL fusions. Finally, through combinatorial analysis of miRNA and mRNA arrays of mouse bone marrow progenitor cells transfected with this miRNA cluster and/or MLL fusion gene, we identified 363 potential miR-17-92 target genes that exhibited a significant inverse correlation of expression with the miRNAs. Remarkably, these potential target genes are significantly enriched (P < 0.01; >2-fold) in cell differentiation, hematopoiesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Taken together, our studies suggest that overexpression of miR-17-92 cluster in MLL-rearranged leukemias is likely attributed to both DNA copy number amplification and direct up-regulation by MLL fusions, and that the miRNAs in this cluster may play an essential role in the development of MLL-associated leukemias through inhibiting cell differentiation and apoptosis, while promoting cell proliferation, by regulating relevant target genes.",2010,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Multigene Family']",20133587,hsa-mir-17,No
640,Urinary Exosomal MicroRNA Profiling in Incipient Type 2 Diabetic Kidney Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Albuminuria is an early sign but not a strong predictor of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Owing to their high stability, urinary exosomal miRNAs can be useful predictors of the progression of early-stage DKD to renal failure; fluid biopsies are ideal for detecting abnormalities in these miRNAs. The aim of this study was to identify novel differentially expressed miRNAs as urine biomarkers for type 2 DKD by comparing between patients of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with and without macroalbuminuria. METHODS: Ten patients with T2D, including five who had no renal disease and five with macroalbuminuria (DKD G1-2A3), were selected for this study. Exosome- (UExo-) derived miRNA profiles were used to identify candidate biomarkers, a subset of which was verified using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: A total of 496 UExo-derived miRNA species were found to be differentially expressed (>2-fold) in patients with DKD, compared to those with T2D. A validation analysis revealed that three miRNAs (miR-362-3p, miR-877-3p, and miR-150-5p) were upregulated and one (miR-15a-5p) was downregulated. These miRNAs might regulate DKD through p53, mTOR, and AMPK pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, UExo-derived miRNAs were altered in type 2 DKD.

62,"Circular RNA circ_0007142 regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion via miR-455-5p/SGK1 axis in colorectal cancer.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Accumulating researches suggested that circular RNA 0007142 (circ_0007142) contributed to the progression and initiation of CRC. However, the molecular mechanism of circ_0007142 in CRC needs further research. Levels of circ_0007142, microRNA-455-5p (miR-455-5p), and serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1) were identified by quantitative real-time PCR. Cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazol-3-ium bromide assay. Flow cytometry assay was used to detect cell apoptosis in SW480 and HCT116 cells. The relative proteins expression was detected by western blot. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using transwell assay. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to determine the relationship between miR-455-5p and circ_0007142 or SGK1. Finally, xenograft tumor model was established to confirm the effect of circ_0007142 on CRC progression in vivo. Circ_0007142 and SGK1 levels were clearly increased, while miR-455-5p level was reduced in CRC tissues and cell lines. Circ_0007142 silencing promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while these effects of circ_0007142 were partially abolished by miR-455-5p inhibitor in CRC cells. Circ_0007142 could sponge miR-455-5p to regulate SGK1 expression. Moreover, the effects of miR-455-5p on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion could be partially reversed by SGK1 overexpression.

117,Long non‑coding RNA BANCR mediates esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by regulating the IGF1R/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway via miR‑338‑3p.,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a type of digestive tract malignant tumor that severely threatens human health. The long non‑coding RNA BRAF activated non‑coding RNA (BANCR) and insulin‑like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) are associated with various types of cancer; however, it remains unclear whether BANCR can regulate IGF1R expression in ESCC. In the present study, the expression levels of BANCR, IGF1R mRNA and microRNA‑338‑3p (miRNA/miR‑338‑3p) in ESCC tissues or cells were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The levels of IGF1R, E‑cadherin, N‑cadherin, Vimentin, p‑Raf‑1, p‑MEK1/2 and p‑ERK1/2 were measured by western blot analysis. The proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells were determined by 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or Transwell assays. The relationship between miR‑338‑3p and BANCR or IGF1R was predicted using starBase2.0 and confirmed by dual‑luciferase reporter assay. The role of BANCR in ESCC in vivo was confirmed through a tumor xenograft assay. It was found that BANCR and IGF1R were upregulated, while miR‑338‑3p was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cells. Both BANCR and IGF1R knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ESCC cells. IGF1R enhancement reversed BANCR knockdown‑mediated effects on the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of ESCC cells. BANCR regulated the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by regulating IGF1R expression. Notably, BANCR regulated IGF1R expression by sponging miR‑338‑3p. Moreover, BANCR silencing inhibited tumor growth in vivo. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that BANCR inhibition blocks ESCC progression by inactivating the IGF1R/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by sponging miR‑338‑3p.",2020 Oct,"['Disease Progression', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*genetics', 'raf Kinases/*genetics']",32945416,hsa-mir-338,Yes

RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of MIR155HG, miR-155-5p, miR-155-3p in clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines. To study the effects of blocking LncRNA MIR155HG and interfering with miR-155-5p and miR-155-3p on the biological function. The g proliferation of tumor was detected by CCK-8, and the cell invasion and migration abilities were detected by wound healing and transwell experiments. Western blot analyzed protein levels of KI67, PCNA, MMP2 and MMP9. Furthermore, TargetScan and miRDB were used to predict the co-target gene of miR-155-3p and miR-155-5p, and the functional analysis of co-target genes was performed using the DAVID. In the current research, the expression of MIR155HG was increased in ccRCC. Interference of MIR155HG inhibited the cellular functions of ccRCC cells, which was reversed by overexpression of miR-155-3p and miR-155-5p. In addition, MIR155HG interference repressed the expression of miR-155-5p and miR-155-3p in ccRCCs, while inhibition of miR-155-5p and miR-155-3p restrained the proliferation, invasion and migration of ccRCCs. Bioinformatics software analysis showed 13 co-targeting genes of miR-155-3p and miR-155-5p.

3050,Signalling in inflammatory skin disease by AP-1 (Fos/Jun).,"Skin inflammation is a physiological reaction to tissue injury, pathogen invasion and irritants. During this process, innate and/or adaptive immune cells are activated and recruited to the site of inflammation to either promote or suppress inflammation. The sequential recruitment and activation of immune cells is modulated by a combination of cytokines and chemokines, which are regulated by transcription factors, such as AP-1 (Fos/Jun), NF-κB, NFATs, and STATs. Here we review the present evidence and the underlying mechanisms of how Jun/AP-1 proteins control skin inflammation. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) in which AP-1 proteins are deleted in the epidermis have revealed that these proteins control cytokine expression at multiple levels. Constitutive epidermal deletion of JunB in mice leads to a multi-organ disease characterised by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These JunB-deficient mutant mice display several phenotypes from skin inflammation to a G-CSF-dependent myeloproliferative disease, as well as kidney atrophy and bone loss, reminiscent of psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Importantly, epidermal deletion of both JunB and c-Jun in an inducible manner in adult mice leads to a psoriasis-like disease, in which the epidermal proteome expression profile is comparable to the one from psoriasis patient samples. In this GEMM and in psoriasis patient-derived material, S100A8/A9-dependent C3/CFB complement activation, as well as a miR-21-dependent TIMP-3/TACE pathway leading to TNF-α shedding, plays causal roles in disease development. The newly identified therapeutic targets from GEMMs together with investigations in human patient samples open up new avenues for therapeutic interventions for psoriasis and related inflammatory skin diseases.",2015,"['Animals', 'Dermatitis/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Skin/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics/*metabolism']",26458100,hsa-mir-21,No
2908,Gastric adenocarcinoma microRNA profiles in fixed tissue and in plasma reveal,"MicroRNA expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) or plasma may add value for cancer management. The GastroGenus miR Panel was developed to measure 55 cancer-specific human microRNAs, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded microRNAs, and controls. This Q-rtPCR panel was applied to 100 FFPEs enriched for adenocarcinoma or adjacent non-malignant mucosa, and to plasma of 31 patients. In FFPE, microRNAs upregulated in malignant versus adjacent benign gastric mucosa were hsa-miR-21, -155, -196a, -196b, -185, and -let-7i. Hsa-miR-18a, 34a, 187, -200a, -423-3p, -484, and -744 were downregulated. Plasma of cancer versus non-cancer controls had upregulated hsa-miR-23a, -103, and -221 and downregulated hsa-miR-378, -346, -486-5p, -200b, -196a, -141, and -484. EBV-infected versus uninfected cancers expressed multiple EBV-encoded microRNAs, and concomitant dysregulation of four human microRNAs suggests that viral infection may alter cellular biochemical pathways. Human microRNAs were dysregulated between malignant and benign gastric mucosa and between plasma of cancer patients and non-cancer controls. Strong association of EBV microRNA expression with known EBV status underscores the ability of microRNA technology to reflect disease biology. Expression of viral microRNAs in concert with unique human microRNAs provides novel insights into viral oncogenesis and reinforces the potential for microRNA profiles to aid in classifying gastric cancer subtypes.

365,MiR-200c increases the radiosensitivity of non-small-cell lung cancer cell line,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to participate in many important cellular processes including radiosensitization. VEGF family, an important regulator of angiogenesis, also plays a crucial role in the regulation of cancer cell radiosensitivity. VEGFR2 mediates the major growth and permeability actions of VEGF in a paracrine/autocrine manner. MiR-200c, at the nexus of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is predicted to target VEGFR2. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that regulation of VEGFR2 pathway by miR-200c could modulate the radiosensitivity of cancer cells. Bioinformatic analysis, luciferase reporter assays and biochemical assays were carried out to validate VEGFR2 as a direct target of miR-200c. The radiosensitizing effects of miR-200c on A549 cells were determined by clonogenic assays. The downstream regulating mechanism of miR-200c was explored with western blotting assays, FCM, tube formation assays and migration assays. We identified VEGFR2 as a novel target of miR-200c. The ectopic miR-200c increased the radiosensitivity of A549 while miR-200c down-regulation decreased it. Besides, we proved that miR-200c radiosensitized A549 cells by targeting VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway specifically, thus leading to inhibition of its downstream pro-survival signaling transduction and angiogenesis, and serves as a potential target for radiosensitizition research.",2013,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Radiation Tolerance/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*genetics']",24205206,hsa-mir-200c,No

29,MicroRNA-505-5p functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in cervical cancer.,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are considered to be tumor suppressors or oncogenes as they regulate cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and differentiation. Recently, microRNA-505 (miR-505) has been reported as being involved in the progression of several human cancers. In the present study, we aim to investigate the expression rate and functional role of miR-505-5p in cervical cancer (CC) to determine its significance regarding the disease's development.The expression of miR-505-5p and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in specimens of patients with CC and CC cell lines was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot. The relationship between miR-505-5p and CDK5 was verified by luciferase reporter assay. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, Scratch wound healing assay and transwell assay were used to detect the roles of miR-505-5p and CDK5 in CC cell functions. Western Blot was utilized to explore the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers.The result showed that in CC tissues and CC cell lines miR-505-5p was down-regulated while CDK5 level was up-regulated. MiR-505-5p was closely correlated with the metastasis-associated clinicopathological features. Overexpression of miR-505-5p inhibited cell viability, cell metastasis and EMT in CC cells. CDK5 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-505-5p and inverse relationship between them was also observed. Overexpression of CDK5 reduces the inhibitory effects of miR-505-5p in CC.Taken together, these results determine that miR-505-5p is a tumor suppressor miRNA which regulates tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via binding to the functional target CDK5 and demonstrates its potential for future use in the treatment of CC.",2019 Jul 31,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",31266812,hsa-mir-505,Yes
201,The deregulation of miR-17/CCND1 axis during neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells.,"Prostate carcinoma contain foci of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, resulting in an increase of androgen-independent neuroendocrine-like (NE) tumor cells, whose number significantly correlates with tumor aggressiveness and thus lower survival rate. Neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate cancer cells and a potential role of miRNAs within this process are poorly understood. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. The aim of this project was to identify new genes and miRNAs involved in neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were differentiated to NE-like cancer cells and microarray analyses were performed. Microarray results have been validated for the eight most deregulated mRNAs and microRNAs via qRT-PCR and analyzed with different algorithms to predict new targets for deregulated microRNAs. The induced CyclinD1 gene could be validated as new target gene for the repressed miR-17 family containing miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a and miR-106b via reporter gene assays and Western Blot. Functional analysis of miR-17 family shows a high influence on cell proliferation, colony forming ability and apoptosis in LNCaP cells.

186,miR-125a-3p and miR-483-5p promote adipogenesis via suppressing the RhoA/ROCK1/ERK1/2 pathway in multiple symmetric lipomatosis.,"Multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL) is a rare disease characterized by symmetric and abnormal distribution of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT); however, the etiology is largely unknown. We report here that miR-125a-3p and miR-483-5p are upregulated in the SAT of MSL patients, promoting adipogenesis through suppressing the RhoA/ROCK1/ERK1/2 pathway. TaqMan microRNA (miR) array analysis revealed that 18 miRs were upregulated in the SAT of MSL patients. Transfection of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) with the individual agomirs of these 18 miRs showed that miR-125a-3p and miR-483-5p significantly promoted adipogenesis. A dual-luciferase assay showed that RhoA and ERK1 were the targets of miR-125a-3p and miR-483-5p, respectively. Moreover, transfection of hADSCs with mimics of miR-125a-3p and miR-483-5p resulted in a pronounced decrease of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the nucleus; conversely, transfection of hADSCs with inhibitors of miR-125a-3p and miR-483-5p led to a significant increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the nucleus. Most importantly, we found that miR-125a-3p and miR-483-5p promoted de novo adipose tissue formation in nude mice. These results demonstrated that miR-125a-3p and miR-483-5p coordinately promoted adipogenesis through suppressing the RhoA/ROCK1/ERK1/2 pathway.

This study aimed to investigate the functions of circ_0001742 on regulating tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) development and the underlying mechanisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of circ_0001742, miR-431-5p and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins and ATF3 were measured by Western blot analysis. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry assay were used to evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Besides, Cell migration and invasion were assessed by transwell assay. The relationships between circ_0001742 and miR-431-5p, miR-431-5p and ATF3 were predicted by online software and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and pull-down assay. RESULTS: The expression of circ_0001742 was upregulated in TSCC tissues and cells. Knockdown of circ_0001742 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT and induced apoptosis in TSCC cells. Then, miR-431-5p was identified as a target of circ_0001742, and knockdown of miR-431-5p reversed the effects of circ_0001742 knockdown on proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and EMT of TSCC cells. Moreover, miR-431-5p could bind to ATF3, and overexpression of ATF3 rescued the effects mediated by miR-431-5p in TSCC cells. In addition, circ_0001742 regulated ATF3 expression through miR-431-5p.

803,Chronic and Intermittent Hyperglycemia Modulates Expression of Key Molecules of,"BACKGROUND: Due to its prominence in the regulation of metabolism and inflammation, adipose tissue is a major target to investigate alterations in insulin action. This hormone activates PI3K/AKT pathway which is essential for glucose homeostasis, cell differentiation, and proliferation in insulin-sensitive tissues, like adipose tissue. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of chronic and intermittent high glucose on the expression of biomolecules of insulin signaling pathway during the differentiation and maturation of human visceral preadipocytes. METHODS: Human visceral preadipocytes (HPA-V) cells were treated with high glucose (30 mM)during the proliferation and/or differentiation and/or maturation stage. The level of mRNA (by Real-Time PCR) and protein (by Elisa tests) expression of IRS1, PI3K, PTEN, AKT2, and GLUT4 was examined after each culture stage. Furthermore, we investigated whether miR-29a-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-152-3p, miR-186-5p, miR-370-3p, and miR-374b-5p may affect the expression of biomolecules of the insulin signaling pathway. RESULTS: Both chronic and intermittent hyperglycemia affects insulin signaling in visceral pre/adipocytes by upregulation of analyzed PI3K/AKT pathway molecules. Both mRNA and protein expression level is more dependent on stage-specific events than the length of the period of high glucose exposure.

440,Evaluation of microRNA expression profiles that may predict recurrence of localized stage I non-small cell lung cancer after surgical resection.,"Prognostic markers that can predict the relapse of localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have yet to be defined. We surveyed expression profiles of microRNA (miRNA) in stage I NSCLC to identify patterns that might predict recurrence after surgical resection of this common deadly cancer. Small RNAs extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were hybridized to locked nucleic acid probes against 752 human miRNAs (representing 82% of the miRNAs in the miRBase 13.0 database) to obtain expression profiles for 37 cases with recurrence and 40 cases without recurrence (with clinical follow-up for at least 32 months). Differential expression between the two case groups was detected for 49% of the miRNAs (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P<0.01). The performance of expression profiles at differentiating the two case groups was assessed by leave-one-out and Monte Carlo cross-validations. In leave-one-out cross-validation using support vector machines- or top-scoring gene pair classifier methods, which looked for six- or two-miRNA-based classifiers, the identified miRNA expression pattern predicted recurrence with an accuracy of 70% and 83%, and hazard ratio of 3.6 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.8-7.1] and 9.0 (95% CI, 4.4-18.2), respectively. Mean accuracy in Monte Carlo cross-validation using 1,000 random 60-17 splits was 69% (95% CI, 68-70) and 72% (95% CI, 71-72), respectively. The specific miRNAs mir-200b*, mir-30c-1*, mir-510, mir-630, mir-657, and mir-146b-3p and mir-124*, mir-585, and mir-708, respectively, represented most commonly among the 1,000 classifiers identified in Monte Carlo cross-validation by the two methods. MiRNAs mir-488, mir-503, and mir-647 were identified as potential reference miRNAs for future studies, based on the stability of their expression patterns across the 77 cases and the two case-groups.

248,Influence of high glucose in the expression of miRNAs and IGF1R signaling pathway,"PURPOSE: Several roles are attributed to the myometrium including sperm and embryo transport, menstrual discharge, control of uterine blood flow, and labor. Although being a target of diabetes complications, the influence of high glucose on this compartment has been poorly investigated. Both miRNAs and IGF1R are associated with diabetic complications in different tissues. Herein, we examined the effects of high glucose on the expression of miRNAs and IGF1R signaling pathway in the human myometrium. METHODS: Human myometrial explants were cultivated for 48 h under either high or low glucose conditions. Thereafter, the conditioned medium was collected for biochemical analyses and the myometrial samples were processed for histological examination as well as miRNA and mRNA expression profiling by qPCR. RESULTS: Myometrial structure and morphology were well preserved after 48 h of cultivation in both high and low glucose conditions. Levels of lactate, creatinine, LDH and estrogen in the supernatant were similar between groups. An explorative screening by qPCR arrays revealed that 6 out of 754 investigated miRNAs were differentially expressed in the high glucose group. Data validation by single qPCR assays confirmed diminished expression of miR-215-5p and miR-296-5p, and also revealed reduced miR-497-3p levels. Accordingly, mRNA levels of IGF1R and its downstream mediators FOXO3 and PDCD4, which are potentially targeted by miR-497-3p, were elevated under high glucose conditions. In contrast, mRNA expression of IGF1, PTEN, and GLUT1 was unchanged.

190,Identification of reference genes and miRNAs for qRT-PCR in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"It is important to select an appropriate reference gene and miRNA when using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to analyze gene and miRNA expression. However, many commonly used reference genes and miRNAs are not stably expressed and therefore not suitable for normalization or quantification of qRT-PCR data. This study aims to identify appropriate reference genes and miRNAs for use in human esophageal squamous carcinoma qRT-PCR analysis. Using data provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified DDX5, LAPTM4A, P4HB, RHOA, miR-28-5p, miR-34a-5p, and miR-186-5p as candidate reference genes and miRNAs. We used qRT-PCR to verify the expression levels of these candidates and another seven commonly used reference genes and miRNAs. A set of 50 paired human normal esophageal tissues and squamous cell carcinoma samples were used in the analysis. We then used geNorm and NormFinder to analyze the results.

Dysregulation of miR-155 and miR-146a expression levels has been well-described in viral hepatitis B (HBV). In the current study, we aimed to assess rs767649 T/A and rs57095329 A/G polymorphisms in miR-155, and miR-146a genes, respectively, as risk factors for Chronic HBV (CHBV) in the Egyptian population. Also, we aimed to do in silico analysis to investigate the molecules that primarily target these miRNAs. One hundred patients diagnosed as CHBV and one hundred age and sex-matched controls with evidence of past HBV infection were genotyped for miR-155 (rs767649) and miR-146a (rs57095329) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The rs767649 AT and AA genotypes in CHBV patients confer four folds and ten folds risk respectively, as compared to control subjects [(AOR = 4.245 (95%CI 2.009-8.970), p<0.0001) and AOR = 10.583 (95%CI 4.012-27.919), p<0.0001, respectively)]. The rs767649 A allele was associated with an increased risk of developing CHBV (AOR = 2.777 (95%CI 1.847-4.175), p<0.0001). There was a significant difference in the frequency of rs57095329 AG and GG genotypes in CHBV patients compared to controls. AG and GG genotypes showed an increase in the risk of developing CHBV by about three and six folds respectively [AOR = 2.610 (95%CI 1.362-5.000), p = 0.004] and [AOR = 5.604 (95%CI 2.157-14.563), p<0.0001].We concluded that rs57095329 and rs767649 SNPs can act as potential risk factors for the development of CHBV in the Egyptian population.",2021,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/epidemiology/*genetics/virology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Risk Factors']",34437653,hsa-mir-146a,Yes
1138,MicroRNA-145 influences the balance of Th1/Th2 via regulating RUNX3 in asthma,"AIM OF THE STUDY: To delineate the underlying mechanism of microRNA-145 modulate the balance of Th1/Th2 via targeting RUNX3 in asthma patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from asthma patients and healthy controls. CD4(+) T cells were isolated and cultured. Using quantitative PCR detect, the level of microRNA-145 and RUNX3 mRNA level in the CD4(+) T cells from asthma patients and healthy controls, meanwhile, western blot was used to detect the RUNX3 protein level. Th1 or Th2 related cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay was performed to confirm the correlation between microRNA-145 and RUNX3. MicroRNA-145 mimic or inhibitor was transfected in the CD4(+) T cells and the changes of RUNX3 level, Th1 or Th2 related cytokines and the percentage of Th1 and Th2 were observed after transfection. RESULTS: MicroRNA-145 level of CD4(+) T cells was higher with a lower RUNX3 expression in asthma patients. There is negative correlation between microRNA-145 and RUNX3. Th2 hyperactivity and Th1 deficiency was detected in the CD4(+) T cells of asthma patients. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay has shown that RUNX3 is a target of microRNA. Up-regulation or down-regulation of miR-145 level caused RUNX3 expression changes in CD4(+) T cells and influence the related cytokines. Inhibition of microRNA-145 may reverse the imbalance of Th1/Th2 in asthma patients. CONCLUSION: MicroRNA-145 could regulate the balance of Th1/Th2 through targeting the RUNX3 in asthma patients.

5,MiRNA-615-3p Alleviates Oxidative Stress Injury of Human Cardiomyocytes Via PI3K/Akt Signaling by Targeting MEF2A.,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction, a coronary heart disease, is a serious hazard to human health. Cardiomyocyte oxidative stress and apoptosis have been considered as the main causes of myocardial infarction. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-615-3p in oxidative stress and apoptosis of human cardiomyocytes. METHODS: Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine miR-615-3p or MEF2A expression in human cardiomyocytes. Apoptosis and viability of human cardiomyocytes were assessed by flow cytometry analysis and CCK-8 assay. In addition, the contents of malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species, and superoxide dismutase were detected by corresponding commercial kits. The binding of miR-615-3p and MEF2A in human cardiomyocytes was examined by luciferase reporterassay. RESULTS: Hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment downregulated the expression level ofmiR-615-3p in human cardiomyocytes. Overexpressing miR-615-3p increased human cardiomyocyte viability and decreased human cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Moreover, miR- 615-3p mimics suppressed oxidative stress in hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated human cardiomyocytes. MEF2A was confirmed as a target gene of miR-615-3p and was highly expressed in hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated human cardiomyocytes, and its upregu-lation partially reversed the influence of miR-615-3p mimics on oxidative stress and apop-tosis of human cardiomyocytes. Moreover, miR-615-3p inactivated the P13K/Akt pathway by inhibiting MEF2A.

2,Effects of microRNA-298 on APP and BACE1 translation differ according to cell type and 3'-UTR variation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques composed of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. However, specific contributions of different cell types to Abeta deposition remain unknown. Non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) play important roles in AD by regulating translation of major associated proteins, such as Abeta precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1), two key proteins associated with Abeta biogenesis. MiRNAs typically silence protein expression via binding specific sites in mRNAs' 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). MiRNAs regulate protein levels in a cell-type specific manner; however, mechanisms of the variation of miRNA activity remain unknown. We report that miR-298 treatment reduced native APP and BACE1 protein levels in an astrocytic but not in a neuron-like cell line. From miR-298's effects on APP-3'-UTR activity and native protein levels, we infer that differences in APP 3'-UTR length could explain differential miR-298 activity. Such varied or truncated, but natural, 3'-UTR specific to a given cell type provides an opportunity to regulate native protein levels by particular miRNA. Thus, miRNA's effect tailoring to a specific cell type, bypassing another undesired cell type with a truncated 3'-UTR would potentially advance clinically-relevant translational research.",2022 Feb 23,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*genetics']",35197498,hsa-mir-298,Yes
98,Reliability of miRNA Analysis from Fixed and Paraffin-Embedded Tissues.,"In clinical practice, patients' tissues are fixed and paraffin-embedded in order to enable histological diagnosis. Nowadays, those tissues are also used for molecular characterization. Formalin is the most used fixative worldwide, and Bouin's solution in some worldwide institutions. Among molecular targets, micro RNAs (miRNAs), the single-stranded non-coding RNAs comprised of 18 to 24 nucleotides, have been demonstrated to be resistant to fixation and paraffin-embedding processes, with consequent possible application in clinical practice. In the present study, let-7e-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-92a-1-5p, miR-30d-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-200a-3p, and miR-429 were investigated in formalin and matched Bouin's solution-fixed tissues of high grade serous ovarian cancers by means of real-time and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Micro RNAs were detectable and analyzable in both formalin- and Bouin's-fixed specimens, but on average, higher Ct values and lower copies/µL were found in Bouin's-fixed samples. Data from formalin-fixed samples correlated significantly for most targets with Bouin's ones, except for let-7e-5p and miR-155-5p. This study shows that miRNAs are analyzable in both formalin- and Bouin's-fixed specimens, with the possibility, after proper data normalization, to compare miRNA-based data from formalin-fixed samples to those of Bouin's-fixed ones.",2019,"['Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Paraffin Embedding', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tissue Fixation']",31569791,hsa-mir-30d,No
174,lncRNA PVT1 promotes the angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cell by targeting miR‑26b to activate CTGF/ANGPT2.,"Angiogenesis is essential for various biological processes, including tumor blood supply delivery, cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been previously reported to affect angiogenesis of glioma microvascular endothelial cells by regulating microRNA (miR)‑186 expression level. However, the specific underlying molecular mechanism of PVT1 regulation of angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the role of PVT1 in cell proliferation, migration and vascular tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using MTT assay, Transwell migration assay and in vitro vascular tube formation assay, respectively. In order to determine the effect of miR‑26b on cell proliferation, migration and vascular tube formation of HUVECs, miR‑26 mimic or miR‑26b inhibitor were transfected into HUVECs. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were conducted to quantify the mRNA and protein expression levels of target genes. The present study confirmed that miR‑26b bound 3'‑untranslated region (3'‑UTR) and subsequently influenced gene expression level using dual luciferase reporter assay. The current study observed that PVT1 affected cell proliferation, migration and in vitro vascular tube formation of HUVECs. In addition, it was determined that PVT1 was able to bind and degrade miR‑26b to promote connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) expression. miR‑26b was also identified to have a suppressive role in cell proliferation, migration and in vitro vascular tube formation of HUVECs via binding 3'‑UTR regions and downregulating CTGF and ANGPT2 expression levels. The current findings may improve the understanding of the underlying mechanism of PVT1 contributing to angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells and offer rationale for targeting PVT1 to treat angiogenesis dysfunction‑associated diseases, including cancer metastasis.",2018 Jul,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Angiopoietin-2/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Connective Tissue Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism']",29620147,hsa-mir-26b,Yes
6,"Circular RNA_0000190 and its target microRNA-767-5p are dysregulated, and they are related to risk stratification as well as prognosis in multiple myeloma patients.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the correlation between circular RNA_0000190 (circ_0000190) and microRNA-767-5p (miR-767-5p), and their correlations with biochemical indices, risk stratification, treatment response, and survival in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) plasma cells of 86 MM patients (during standard diagnostic procedures) and 30 healthy donors (HDs) (examination of the eligibility for BM transplantation) were obtained, among which circ_0000190 and miR-767-5p expressions were detected using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In MM patients, Durie-Salmon stage and International Staging System (ISS) stage were assessed. Clinical responses (including complete response (CR) and objective response rate (ORR)) were assessed. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. RESULTS: Circ_0000190 was decreased, but miR-767-5p was increased in MM patients compared with HDs. Circ_0000190 was negatively correlated with miR-767-5p in both HDs and MM patients. In MM patients, circ_0000190 was negatively correlated with ISS stage, serum creatinine, beta-2-microglobulin, and lactate dehydrogenase but was positively correlated with albumin. Whereas an opposite trend in miR-767-5p was observed. Regarding clinical response, circ_0000190 had the value for predicting increased ORR, while miR-767-5p had the value for predicting decreased CR and ORR. Circ_0000190 high expression was correlated with better PFS and OS, while miR-767-5p high expression was correlated with worse PFS and OS. Multivariate Cox's analyses revealed circ_0000190 high expression as an independent factor predicting better OS.

1421,miR-21-mediated Radioresistance Occurs via Promoting Repair of DNA Double Strand,"miR-21, as an oncogene that overexpresses in most human tumors, is involved in radioresistance; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that miR-21-mediated radioresistance occurs through promoting repair of DNA double strand breaks, which includes facilitating both non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR). The miR-21-promoted NHEJ occurs through targeting GSK3B (a novel target of miR-21), which affects the CRY2/PP5 pathway and in turn increases DNA-PKcs activity. The miR-21-promoted HRR occurs through targeting both GSK3B and CDC25A (a known target of miR-21), which neutralizes the effects of targeting GSK3B-induced CDC25A increase because GSK3B promotes degradation of both CDC25A and cyclin D1, but CDC25A and cyclin D1 have an opposite effect on HRR. A negative correlation of expression levels between miR-21 and GSK3β exists in a subset of human tumors. Our results not only elucidate miR-21-mediated radioresistance, but also provide potential new targets for improving radiotherapy.",2017,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/radiation effects', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/radiation effects', '*DNA Repair/radiation effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation/radiation effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Recombinational DNA Repair/radiation effects']",28096467,hsa-mir-21,No
175,MicroRNA functions in osteogenesis and dysfunctions in osteoporosis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that control osteoblast mediated bone formation and osteoclast-related bone remodeling. Deregulation of miRNA mediated mechanisms is emerging as an important pathological factor in bone degeneration (eg, osteoporosis) and other bone-related diseases. MiRNAs are intriguing regulatory molecules that are networked with cell signaling pathways and intricate transcriptional programs through ingenuous circuits with remarkably simple logic. This overview examines key principles by which miRNAs control differentiation of osteoblasts as they evolve from mesenchymal stromal cells during osteogenesis, or of osteoclasts as they originate from monocytic precursors in the hematopoietic lineage during osteoclastogenesis. Of particular note are miRNAs that are temporally upregulated during osteoblastogenesis (eg, miR-218) or osteoclastogenesis (eg, miR-148a). Each miRNA stimulates differentiation by suppressing inhibitory signaling pathways ('double-negative' regulation). The excitement surrounding miRNAs in bone biology stems from the prominent effects that individual miRNAs can have on biological transitions during differentiation of skeletal cells and correlations of miRNA dysfunction with bone diseases. MiRNAs have significant clinical potential which is reflected by their versatility as disease-specific biomarkers and their promise as therapeutic agents to ameliorate or reverse bone tissue degeneration.",2013,"['Bone Remodeling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Osteogenesis/*genetics', 'Osteoporosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",23605904,hsa-mir-148a,No
347,BRMS1L suppresses breast cancer metastasis by inducing epigenetic silence of FZD10.,"BRMS1L (breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 like, BRMS1-like) is a component of Sin3A-histone deacetylase (HDAC) co-repressor complex that suppresses target gene transcription. Here we show that reduced BRMS1L in breast cancer tissues is associated with metastasis and poor patient survival. Functionally, BRMS1L inhibits breast cancer cells migration and invasion by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These effects are mediated by epigenetic silencing of FZD10, a receptor for Wnt signalling, through HDAC1 recruitment and histone H3K9 deacetylation at the promoter. Consequently, BRMS1L-induced FZD10 silencing inhibits aberrant activation of WNT3-FZD10-beta-catenin signalling. Furthermore, BRMS1L is a target of miR-106b and miR-106b upregulation leads to BRMS1L reduction in breast cancer cells. RNA interference-mediated silencing of BRMS1L expression promotes metastasis of breast cancer xenografts in immunocompromised mice, whereas ectopic BRMS1L expression inhibits metastasis. Therefore, BRMS1L provides an epigenetic regulation of Wnt signalling in breast cancer cells and acts as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor.",2014 Nov 19,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Female', 'Frizzled Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'Wnt3 Protein/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",25406648,hsa-mir-106b,Yes
53,"Identification of key microRNAs, transcription factors and genes associated with congenital obstructive nephropathy in a mouse model of megabladder.","OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying congenital obstructive nephropathy (CON). METHODS: The microarray dataset GSE70879 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, including 3 kidney samples of megabladder mice and 4 control kidneys. Using this dataset, differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified between the kidney samples from megabladder mice and controls, followed by identification of the target genes for these DEMs and construction of a DEM and target gene interaction network. Additionally, the target genes were subjected to Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, and were used for construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Finally, regulatory networks were constructed to analyze transcription factors for the key miRNAs. RESULTS: From 17 DEMs identified between kidney samples of megabladder mice and controls, 3 key miRNAs were screened, including mmu-miR-150-5p, mmu-miR-374b-5p and mmu-miR-126a-5p. The regulatory networks identified vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) as the common target gene of mmu-miR-150-5p and five transcription factors, including nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (Nr4a2), Jun dimerisation protein 2 (Jdp2), Kruppel-like factor 6 (Klf6), Neurexophilin-3 (Nxph3) and RNA binding motif protein 17 (Rbm17). The gene encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) was found to be co-regulated by mmu-miR-374b-5p and high mobility group protein A1 (Hmga1), whereas the kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (Kras) was identified as a common target gene of mmu-miR-126a-5p and paired box 6 (Pax6).

346,Analysis of tissue and serum microRNA expression in patients with upper urinary,"INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs play an important role in many human malignancies; so far, their expression remains to be studied in upper urinary tract urothelial cancer (UUTUC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of eleven microRNAs (miR-10a, miR-21, miR-96, miR-135, miR-141, miR-182, miR-200b, miR-205, miR-429, miR-520b, miR-1244) formerly shown to be upregulated in urothelial bladder cancer were studied in corresponding normal and cancerous tissue samples of patients undergoing nephroureterectomy for UUTUC. Upregulated microRNAs were then measured in serum samples of patients with UUTUC and patients with non-malignant urological diseases to evaluate their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for UUTUC.

10,Reduced expression of miR-564 is associated with worse prognosis in patients with osteosarcoma.,"OBJECTIVE: MiR-564 has been reported to be involved in the development of several types of cancers. However, its clinical significance in osteosarcoma (OS) has not been investigated. We aimed to explore the prognostic value of miR-564 in OS patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR assay was used to detect the expression levels of miR-564 in OS tissues and matched normal bone tissues. The correlation between miR-564 expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed by Pearson's chi2-test. The disease-free survival and overall survival rates of OS patients were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analysis was used to assess factors related to survival. RESULTS: We observed that the level of miR-564 was significantly reduced in OS tissues compared with that in the paired noncancerous bone tissues (p < 0.01). In addition, low miR-564 expression was found to be closely correlated with advanced clinical stage (p = 0.000) and distant metastasis (p = 0.003). Furthermore, survival analyses showed that patients with low expression of miR-564 had a shorter overall survival (p = 0.001) and disease-free survival (p = 0.001) than those with high expression of miR-564. Finally, we showed that miR-564 was an independent poor prognostic factor for both 5-year overall survival (p = 0.001) and 5-year disease-free survival (p = 0.001) through multivariate analysis.

187,Pepsinogen C expression-related lncRNA/circRNA/mRNA profile and its co-mediated,"The expression of pepsinogen C (PGC) is considered an ideal negative biomarker of gastric cancer, but its pathological mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to analyze competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks related to PGC expression at a post-transcriptional level and build an experimental basis for studying the role of PGC in the progression of gastric cancer. RNA sequencing technology was used to detect the differential expression (DE) profiles of PGC-related long non-coding (lnc)RNAs, circular (circ)RNAs, and mRNAs. Ggcorrplot R package and online database were used to construct DElncRNAs/DEcircRNAs co-mediated PGC expression-related ceRNA networks. In vivo and in vitro validations were performed using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). RNA sequencing found 637 DEmRNAs, 698 DElncRNAs, and 38 DEcircRNAs. The PPI network of PGC expression-related mRNAs consisted of 503 nodes and 1179 edges. CFH, PPARG, and MUC6 directly interacted with PGC. Enrichment analysis suggested that DEmRNAs were mainly enriched in cancer-related pathways. Eleven DElncRNAs, 13 circRNAs, and 35 miRNA-mRNA pairs were used to construct ceRNA networks co-mediated by DElncRNAs and DEcircRNAs that were PGC expression-related. The network directly related to PGC was as follows: SNHG16/hsa_circ_0008197-hsa-mir-98-5p/hsa-let-7f-5p/hsa-let-7c-5p-PGC. qRT-PCR validation results showed that PGC, PPARG, SNHG16, and hsa_circ_0008197 were differentially expressed in gastric cancer cells and tissues: PGC positively correlated with PPARG (r = 0.276, P = 0.009), SNHG16 (r = 0.35, P = 0.002), and hsa_circ_0008197 (r = 0.346, P = 0.005). PGC-related DElncRNAs and DEcircRNAs co-mediated complicated ceRNA networks to regulate PGC expression, thus affecting the occurrence and development of gastric cancer at a post-transcriptional level.

Previous analyses have reported that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as biomarkers for a number of diseases. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to detect the serum miRNAs that are differentially expressed between endometriosis patients and negative controls to evaluate the potential of these miRNAs as diagnostic markers for endometriosis. DESIGN: A total of 765 serum miRNAs were profiled using a TaqMan microRNA array in a pool of 10 endometriosis patients and a pool of 10 negative controls, and a set of selected miRNAs were further analyzed in a validation cohort consisting of sera from 60 patients and 25 controls including 10 samples used in array profiling. RESULTS: The relative expression levels of miR-199a and miR-122 were found to be up-regulated in endometriosis patient samples compared with control samples, whereas miR-145*, miR-141*, miR-542-3p, and miR-9* were down-regulated in endometriosis patients. Importantly, the relative expression of miR-199a (P < 0.05) and miR-122 can be used to discriminate between severe and mild endometriosis. We also found that miR-199a is well correlated with pelvic adhesion and lesion distribution (P < 0.05) and associated with hormone-mediated signaling pathways. Furthermore, we investigated the diagnostic value of these molecules and confirmed the optimal combination of miR-199a, miR-122, miR-145*, and miR-542-3p with area under the curve of 0.994 (95% confidence interval = 0.984-1.000, P < 0.001) and a cutoff point (0.4950) of 93.22% sensitivity and 96.00% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the circulating miRNAs miR-199a, miR-122, miR-145*, and miR-542-3p could potentially serve as noninvasive biomarkers for endometriosis. miR-199a may also play an important role in the progression of the disease.

2,Identification of microRNAs associated with lymphangiogenesis in human gastric cancer.,"PURPOSE: Lymphatic metastasis is a primary cause of gastric cancer-related death, yet factors governing tumor cell lymphatic metastasis have not been fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of regulatory, non-coding RNAs, some of which are involved in gastric cancer progression. However, little is known about which miRNA contributes to the lymphatic metastasis in human gastric cancer. This prompted us to find the significant miRNAs associated with lymphangiogenesis in human gastric cancer. METHODS: We screened vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) expression in several gastric cancer cell lines as well as in the immortalized human gastric mucosal cell line GES-1, by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The gastric cancer cell lines MKN-45 and SGC-7901, which have commonly been cultured with human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) in vitro, promoted tube formation of HLECs following transformation with a VEGF-C expression vector. Using microarrays, we identified a panel of differentially expressed miRNAs in HLECs that had been co-cultured with VEGF-C-transformed gastric cancer cells compared with non-transformed gastric cancer cells. A subset of miRNAs was further validated using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: We found altered expression of miRNAs in HLECs co-cultured with lymphangiogenesis-inducing VEGF-C-transformed gastric cancer cells, with 47 up-regulated and 42 down-regulated miRNAs. These findings were confirmed by qRT-PCR of selected miRNAs. Furthermore, several miRNAs were differentially expressed in patients with positive lymphatic metastasis of the primary gastric tumor. Up-regulated miRNAs included miR-648, miR-5002-3p, miR-4754, miR-4760-5p, miR-4491, miR-4252, miR-5007-3p, and miR-647; and down-regulated miRNAs included miR-3178, miR-593-5p, miR-4485, miR-135a-3p, miR-17, miR-1469, and miR-124-5p. CONCLUSIONS: Several lymphangiogenesis-related miRNAs are significantly altered during lymphatic metastasis of gastric cancer.",2014 Apr,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Lymphangiogenesis/*genetics', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Transfection']",23881463,hsa-mir-4252,No
38,Hsa-miR-520d converts fibroblasts into CD105+ populations.,"BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that hsa-miR-520d-5p can convert cancer cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) via a dedifferentiation by a demethylation mechanism. METHODS: We tested the effect of miR-520d-5p on human fibroblasts to determine whether it could be safely used in normal cells for future clinical therapeutic applications. After we transfected the microRNA into fibroblasts, we analyzed the phenotypic changes, gene expression levels, and stemness induction in vitro, and we evaluated tumor formation in an in vivo xenograft model. RESULTS: The transfected fibroblasts turned into CD105+ cell populations, survived approximately 24 weeks, and exhibited increases in both the collagen-producing ability and in differentiation. Combinatorial transfection of small interfering RNAs for miR-520d-5p target genes (ELAVL2, GATAD2B, and TEAD1) produced similar results to miR-520d-5p transfection. These molecules converted normal cells into MSCs and not iPSCs. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro data indicate the potent usefulness of this small molecule as a therapeutic biomaterial in normal cells and cancer cells because CD105+ cells never converted to iPSCs despite repeated transfections and all types of transfectants lost their tumorigenicity. This maintenance of a benign state following miR-520d-5p transfection appears to be caused by p53 upregulation. We conclude that miR-520d-5p may be a useful biomaterial at an in vitro level.",2014 Dec,"['Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'ELAV-Like Protein 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Endoglin', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/immunology', 'GATA Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects', 'MicroRNAs/*pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*immunology', 'Repressor Proteins', 'TEA Domain Transcription Factors', 'Telomere Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors']",25303886,hsa-mir-520d,Yes
6,MicroRNA-95 promotes cell proliferation and targets sorting Nexin 1 in human,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are strongly implicated in cancer but their specific roles and functions in the major cancers have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we defined the oncogenic significance and function of miR-95, which we found to be elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues by microarray analysis. Evaluation of an expanded CRC cohort revealed that miR-95 expression was up-regulated in nearly half of the tumors examined (42/87) compared with the corresponding noncancerous tissues. Ectopic overexpression of miR-95 in human CRC cell lines promoted cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, whereas RNAi-mediated silencing of miR-95 decreased cell growth ratio. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR-95 repressed the expression of reporter gene coupled to the 3'-untranslated region of sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), whereas miR-95 silencing up-regulated SNX1 expression. Moreover, miR-95 expression levels correlated inversely with SNX1 protein levels in human CRC tissues. RNAi-mediated knockdown of SNX1 phenocopied the proliferation-promoting effect of miR-95, whereas overexpression of SNX1 blocked miR-95-induced proliferation of CRC cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-95 increases proliferation by directly targeting SNX1, defining miR-95 as a new oncogenic miRNA in CRC.",2011,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sorting Nexins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",21427358,hsa-mir-95,Yes
3,Human miR-5193 Triggers Gene Silencing in Multiple Genotypes of Hepatitis B Virus.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to various disease states including asymptomatic, acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which remain a major health problem worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that microRNA (miRNAs) plays an important role in viral replication. This study aimed to predict and evaluate human miRNAs targeting multiple genotypes of HBV. Candidate human miRNAs were analyzed by data obtained from miRBase and RNAhybrid. Then miRNAs were selected based on hybridization patterns and minimum free energy (MFE). The silencing effect of miRNA was evaluated by real-time PCR, the luciferase reporter assay and the ELISA assay. Five human miRNAs including miR- 142-5p, miR-384, miR-500b, miR-4731-5p and miR-5193 were found to target several HBV genotypes. Interestingly, miR-5193 was found to be the most potent miRNA that could target against all HBV transcripts in almost all HBV genotypes with a highly stable hybridization pattern (5' canonical with MFE lower than -35 kcal/mol). Moreover, miR-5193 caused significant silencing in luciferase activity (53% reduction), luciferase transcript (60% reduction) and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) production (20-40% reduction depending on genotypes). Therefore, miR-5193 might be useful and have a vital role for inhibition of HBV replication in the future.",2015,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Genotype', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics']",26456535,hsa-mir-5193,Yes
290,Longitudinal Examination of the Intestinal Lamina Propria Cellular Compartment of,"Chronic immune activation/inflammation driven by factors like microbial translocation is a key determinant of human immunodeficiency virus/simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV/SIV) disease progression. Although extensive research on inflammation has focused on studying protein regulators, increasing evidence suggests a critical role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating several aspects of the immune/inflammatory response and immune cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation. To understand their immunoregulatory role, we profiled miRNA expression sequentially in intestinal lamina propria leukocytes (LPLs) of eight macaques before and at 21, 90, and 180 days postinfection (dpi). At 21 dpi, ∼20 and 9 miRNAs were up- and downregulated, respectively. However, at 90 dpi (n = 60) and 180 dpi (n = 44), ≥75% of miRNAs showed decreased expression. Notably, the T-cell activation-associated miR-15b, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, and miR-150 expression was significantly downregulated at 90 and 180 dpi. Out of ∼10 downregulated miRNAs predicted to regulate CD69, we confirmed miR-92a to directly target CD69. Interestingly, the SIV-induced miR-190b expression was elevated at all time points. Additionally, elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive miR-146b-5p expression at 180 dpi was confirmed in primary intestinal macrophages following LPS treatment in vitro Further, reporter and overexpression assays validated IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor 1 kinase) as a direct miR-150 target. Furthermore, IRAK1 protein levels were markedly elevated in intestinal LPLs and epithelium. Finally, blockade of CD8(+) T-cell activation/proliferation with delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) significantly prevented miR-150 downregulation and IRAK1 upregulation. Our findings suggest that miR-150 downregulation during T-cell activation disrupts the translational control of IRAK1, facilitating persistent gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation. Finally, the ability of Δ(9)-THC to block the miR-150-IRAK1 regulatory cascade highlights the potential of cannabinoids to inhibit persistent inflammation/immune activation in HIV/SIV infection. IMPORTANCE: Persistent GI tract disease/inflammation is a cardinal feature of HIV/SIV infection. Increasing evidence points to a critical role for miRNAs in controlling several aspects of the immune/inflammatory response. Here, we show significant dysregulation of miRNA expression exclusively in the intestinal lamina propria cellular compartment through the course of SIV infection. Specifically, the study identified miRNA signatures associated with key pathogenic events, such as viral replication, T-cell activation, and microbial translocation. The T-cell-enriched miR-150 showed significant downregulation throughout SIV infection and was confirmed to target IRAK1, a critical signal-transducing component of the IL-1 receptor and TLR signaling pathways. Reduced miR-150 expression was associated with markedly elevated IRAK1 expression in the intestines of chronically SIV-infected macaques. Finally, Δ(9)-THC-mediated blockade of CD8(+) T-cell activation in vitro significantly inhibited miR-150 downregulation and IRAK1 upregulation, suggesting its potential for targeted immune modulation in HIV infection.",2016,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/genetics', 'Intestinal Mucosa/immunology/virology', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macaca mulatta', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*immunology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Replication']",26937033,hsa-mir-15b,No
11,MicroRNAs in cardiac arrhythmia: DNA sequence variation of MiR-1 and MiR-133A in long QT syndrome.,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic cardiac condition associated with prolonged ventricular repolarization, primarily a result of perturbations in cardiac ion channels, which predisposes individuals to life-threatening arrhythmias. Using DNA screening and sequencing methods, over 700 different LQTS-causing mutations have been identified in 13 genes worldwide. Despite this, the genetic cause of 30-50% of LQTS is presently unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ( approximately  22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding complementary sequences within messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The human genome encodes over 1800 miRNAs, which target about 60% of human genes. Consequently, miRNAs are likely to regulate many complex processes in the body, indeed aberrant expression of various miRNA species has been implicated in numerous disease states, including cardiovascular diseases. MiR-1 and MiR-133A are the most abundant miRNAs in the heart and have both been reported to regulate cardiac ion channels. We hypothesized that, as a consequence of their role in regulating cardiac ion channels, genetic variation in the genes which encode MiR-1 and MiR-133A might explain some cases of LQTS. Four miRNA genes (miR-1-1, miR-1-2, miR-133a-1 and miR-133a-2), which encode MiR-1 and MiR-133A, were sequenced in 125 LQTS probands. No genetic variants were identified in miR-1-1 or miR-133a-1; but in miR-1-2 we identified a single substitution (n.100A> G) and in miR-133a-2 we identified two substitutions (n.-19G> A and n.98C> T). None of the variants affect the mature miRNA products. Our findings indicate that sequence variants of miR-1-1, miR-1-2, miR-133a-1 and miR-133a-2 are not a cause of LQTS in this cohort.",2014 Sep,"['Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Long QT Syndrome/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment']",24809446,hsa-mir-133a-1,No
285,Long Noncoding RNA NEAT1 Aggravates Aβ-Induced Neuronal Damage by Targeting,"PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, with a rising prevalence worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play important roles in the development and treatment of AD. However, the exact role of lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in neuronal damage in AD is largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AD model was established in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells via treatment with amyloid β(1-42) (Aβ). The expression of NEAT1 and microRNA-107 (miR-107) was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. The expression of phosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau) was measured by Western blot. The interaction between NEAT1 and miR-107 was explored by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase activity, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: NEAT1 expression was enhanced in Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells, and its knockdown attenuated Aβ-induced inhibition of viability and promotion of apoptosis and p-Tau levels. NEAT1 was indicated as a decoy of miR-107. miR-107 abundance was reduced in Aβ-treated cells, and its overexpression reversed Aβ-induced injury. Moreover, interference of miR-107 abated silencing of NEAT1-mediated inhibition of neuronal damage in Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells. CONCLUSION: LncRNA NEAT1 aggravated Aβ-induced neuronal damage by sponging miR-107, indicating a novel avenue for treatment of AD.",2019,"['Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/*pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neurons/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/*toxicity', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",31250578,hsa-mir-107,No
37,The microRNA‑708‑5p/ZEB1/EMT axis mediates the metastatic potential of osteosarcoma.,"MicroRNA‑708‑5p (miR‑708‑5p) and epithelial‑​to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been widely identified to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of multiple cancers. However, the connection between miR‑708‑5p and EMT has not been sufficiently clarified. Therefore, our research aimed to investigate the impact of miR‑708‑5p on EMT and the metastasis of osteosarcoma (OS). We first analyzed the differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) from the GSE70367 dataset. We found that the expression of miR‑708‑5p was lower in OS cells. Overexpression of miR‑708‑5p was able to impair the migration and invasion of OS cells. Moreover, miR‑708‑5p inhibited EMT of OS cells MG63 and SaOS‑2, wherein E‑cadherin was increased, and N‑cadherin, vimentin, and Snail were decreased. Semaphorin 4C (SEMA4C), mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP3K3), and zinc finger E‑box‑binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) were predicted as target genes of miR‑708‑5p by bioinformatics method. Only ZEB1, one of the EMT‑inducing transcription factors, was validated as the direct target gene of miR‑708‑5p in OS cells through dual‑luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis. Knockdown of ZEB1 was found to inhibit the metastasis of MG63 and SaOS‑2 cells, whereas ZEB1 over-expression promoted their metastasis. In summary, miR‑708‑5p impaired the metastasis and EMT of OS, which was found to be mediated by inhibition of ZEB1.",2020 Feb,"['Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1/genetics/*metabolism']",31894343,hsa-mir-708,No
183,MicroRNA-320a inhibits breast cancer metastasis by targeting metadherin.,"Dysregulated microRNAs play important pathological roles in carcinogenesis that are yet to be fully elucidated. This study was performed to investigate the biological functions of microRNA-320a (miR-320a) in breast cancer and the underlying mechanisms. Function analyses for cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell invasion/migration, were conducted after miR-320a silencing and overexpression. The specific target genes of miR-320a were predicted by TargetScan algorithm and then determined by dual luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiment. The relationship between miR-320a and its target genes was explored in human breast cancer tissues. We found that miR-320a overexpression could inhibit breast cancer invasion and migration abilities in vitro, while miR-320a silencing could enhance that. In addition, miR-320a could suppress activity of 3'-untranslated region luciferase of metadherin (MTDH), a potent oncogene. The rescue experiment revealed that MTDH was a functional target of miR-320a. Moreover, we found that MTDH was negatively correlated with miR-320a expression, and it was related to clinical outcomes of breast cancer. Further xenograft experiment also showed that miR-320a could inhibit breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Our findings clearly demonstrate that miR-320a suppresses breast cancer metastasis by directly inhibiting MTDH expression. The present study provides a new insight into anti-oncogenic roles of miR-320a and suggests that miR-320a/MTDH pathway is a putative therapeutic target in breast cancer.",2016 Jun 21,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Transfection']",27229534,hsa-mir-320a,Yes
290,Identifying miRNA/mRNA negative regulation pairs in colorectal cancer.,"Although considerable progress has been made in the molecular biology of Colorectal cancer (CRC), novel approaches are still required to uncover the detailed molecular mechanism of CRC. We aim to explore the potential negatively regulated miRNA-mRNA pairs and investigate their regulatory roles so as to elaborate the potential roles of the critical proteins in the signaling pathways enriched by the differential target genes of negatively regulated miRNA in CRC. Firstly, the differential miRNA-mRNA pairs were selected, followed by pairs of miRNA and their target genes. The obtained relationships were subjected to do functional enrichment analysis and those enriched in CRC pathways were chose to further construct a protein interaction network. Finally, we analyzed the regulatory roles of these relationships and constructed a regulatory network of negatively regulated miRNA and mRNA relationships. A total of 372 pairs of miRNA-mRNA were found and 108 target genes of miRNA were obtained. Three miRNAs including hsa-mir-23b, hsa-mir-365-1 and hsa-mir-365-2 showed significant influence on prognosis of CRC patients.

41,Identification of a microRNA (miR-663a) induced by ER stress and its target gene PLOD3 by a combined microRNome and proteome approach.,"INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate gene expression to support important physiological functions. Significant evidences suggest that miRs play a crucial role in many pathological events and in the cell response to various stresses. METHODS: With the aim to identify new miRs induced by perturbation of intracellular calcium homeostasis, we analysed miR expression profiles of thapsigargin (TG)-treated cells by microarray. In order to identify miR-663a-regulated genes, we evaluated proteomic changes in miR-663a-overexpressing cells by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometric identification of the differentially represented proteins. Microarray and proteomic analyses were supported by biochemical validation. RESULTS: Results of microarray revealed 24 differentially expressed miRs; among them, miR-663a turned out to be by ER stress and under the control of the PERK pathway of the unfolded protein response. Proteomic analysis revealed that PLOD3, which is the gene encoding for collagen-modifying lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3), is regulated by miR-663a. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-663a indeed reduces LH3 expression by targeting to 3'-UTR of PLOD3 mRNA. Interestingly, miR-663a inhibition of LH3 expression generates reduced extracellular accumulation of type IV collagen, thus suggesting the involvement of miR-663a in modulating collagen 4 secretion in physiological conditions and in response to ER stress. CONCLUSION: The finding of the ER stress-induced PERK-miR-663a pathway may have important implications in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of this miR in normal and/or pathological conditions.",2016 Aug,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Procollagen-Lysine, 2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proteome/genetics/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",27233793,hsa-mir-663a,No

We conducted a systematic literature review and evaluated the quality of included studies based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess the strengths of the associations. We identified 40 studies for pooled analyses.

132,HAS2-AS1 Acts as a Molecular Sponge for miR-137 and Promotes the Invasion and,"This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism by which HAS2-AS1 acts as a ceRNA to promote the invasion and migration of glioma cells, which will provide a novel potential target for the targeted therapy of glioma. Gene expression profiles and corresponding clinical data were accessed from the TCGA_LGG and TCGA_GBM databases and then differential analysis was conducted using the ""edgeR"" package. miRDB, miRTarBase and TargetScan databases were employed to predict target genes and sequentially a ceRNA network was constructed. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect gene expression in glioma cells. Transwell assay was operated to assess cell migratory and invasive abilities. Western blot was conducted to evaluate the protein expression. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation experiment were performed to validate the targeting relationship between genes. HAS2-AS1 was markedly upregulated in glioma, and the overall survival time of patients with high HAS2-AS1 expression was significantly shorter than that of patients with low one. Silencing HAS2-AS1 inhibited the migration and invasion of glioma cells, while overexpressing HAS2-AS1 produced opposite results. miR-137 was validated as a direct target of and negatively regulated by HAS2-AS1. Further exploration of the downstream target gene indicated that EZH2 competed with HAS2-AS1 to interact with miR-137. Suppressing miR-137 or up-regulating EZH2 reversed the impact of HAS2-AS1 knockdown on glioma cell invasion and migration. HAS2-AS1 regulates EZH2 by sponging miR-137 for the migratory and invasive abilities of glioma cells, which provides a new idea for exploring metastasis mechanism of glioma.",2020,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glioma/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Synthases/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics']",33064966,hsa-mir-137,Yes

The qRT-PCR results showed that plasma miR-34a and miR-146a levels, and CSF miR-34a, miR-125b, and miR-146a levels in AD patients were significantly lower than in control subjects.

931,Glial HMOX1 expression promotes central and peripheral α-synuclein dysregulation,"α-Synuclein is a key player in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). Expression of human heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in astrocytes of GFAP.HMOX1 transgenic (TG) mice between 8.5 and 19 months of age results in a parkinsonian phenotype characterized by neural oxidative stress, nigrostriatal hypodopaminergia associated with locomotor incoordination, and overproduction of α-synuclein. We identified two microRNAs (miR-), miR-153 and miR-223, that negatively regulate α-synuclein in the basal ganglia of male and female GFAP.HMOX1 mice. Serum concentrations of both miRNAs progressively declined in the wild-type (WT) and GFAP.HMOX1 mice between 11 and 19 months of age. Moreover, at each time point surveyed, circulating levels of miR-153 were significantly lower in the TG animals compared to WT controls, while α-synuclein protein concentrations were elevated in erythrocytes of the GFAP.HMOX1 mice at 19 months of age relative to WT values. Primary WT neurons co-cultured with GFAP.HMOX1 astrocytes exhibited enhanced protein oxidation, mitophagy and apoptosis, aberrant expression of genes regulating the dopaminergic phenotype, and an imbalance in gene expression profiles governing mitochondrial fission and fusion. Many, but not all, of these neuronal abnormalities were abrogated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of α-synuclein, implicating α-synuclein as a potent, albeit partial, mediator of HO-1's neurodystrophic effects in these parkinsonian mice. Overexpression of HO-1 in stressed astroglia has previously been documented in the substantia nigra of idiopathic PD and may promote α-synuclein production and toxicity by downmodulating miR-153 and/or miR-223 both within the CNS and in peripheral tissues.",2019,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Neuroglia/*metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Parkinsonian Disorders/*metabolism', 'alpha-Synuclein/*metabolism']",31180611,hsa-mir-223,Yes
611,MicroRNA Expression Analysis of Centenarians and Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients,"Micro-RNA (miRNA) are a family of small non-coding ribonucleic acids that inhibits post-transcriptionally the expression of their target messenger RNA (mRNA). We are interested in studying the involvement of miRNA in longevity and autoimmune diseases. In this study we compared the different expression of seven microRNAs between human plasma healthy controls, plasma samples of centenarians and samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We used the Life Technologies' protocol to quantify seven miRNAs from 62 plasma samples: 20 healthy human controls, 14 centenarians, 28 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TaqMan MicroRNA assays were used to analyze the expression profiles of miR-125b-5p, miR-425-5p, miR-200b5p, miR-200c-3p, miR-579-3p, miR-212-3p, miR-21-5p and miR-126-3p. The relative expression of mature miRNAs was analyzed using software REST. Our results show that miR-425-5p, miR-21 and miR-212 significantly decreased in centenarians and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with controls. Furthermore in this work we highlight a connection between corticosteroid treatment and miRNAs expression.",2017,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Longevity/genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",28824293,hsa-mir-200c,No
240,MicroRNA expression profiles in placenta with severe preeclampsia using a,"INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, the pathophysiology of this disease is not yet fully understood. MiRNA plays an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Recent studies have suggested that dysregulation of miRNAs in placental tissue is involved in the pathogenesis of PE. Therefore, we investigated miRNA profiles in PE placenta to understand the miRNA function in PE pathogenesis. METHODS: MiRNA profiling was performed in 20 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples (10 placentas from severe PE and 10 from a control group). We used a hybridization-based microarray with a PNA-probe comprised of 158 miRNAs. RESULTS: Thirteen miRNAs (miR-92b, miR-197, miR-342-3p, miR-296-5p, miR-26b, miR-25, miR-296-3p, miR-26a, miR-198, miR-202, miR-191, miR-95, and miR-204) were significantly overexpressed and two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-223) were underexpressed in PE compared with the control group. Among 15 differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-26b, miR-296-5p, and miR-223 were found to be consistent with results from previous studies. We identified 893 genes that were predicted by at least three of four computational algorithms. Target genes participated in several signaling pathways, adherens junction, focal adhesion, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. CONCLUSIONS: Several miRNAs are found to be dysregulated in placentas of PE patients and they seem to be closely associated with the early pathogenesis of PE. Further study is necessary to develop tools for early detection and management.",2013,"['Adult', 'Decidua/blood supply/metabolism/pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids/metabolism', 'Placenta/blood supply/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pre-Eclampsia/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Up-Regulation']",23830491,hsa-mir-25,No
180,Extracellular Vesicle MicroRNA That Are Involved in β-Thalassemia Complications.,"Beta thalassemia major (βT) is a hereditary anemia characterized by transfusion-dependency, lifelong requirement of chelation, and organ dysfunction. MicroRNA (miRNA) can be packed into extracellular vesicles (EVs) that carry them to target cells. We explored EV-miRNA in βT and their pathophysiologic role. Circulating EVs were isolated from 35 βT-patients and 15 controls. EV miRNA was evaluated by nano-string technology and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We explored effects of EVs on cell culture proliferation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Higher amounts of small EV (exosomes) were found in patients than in controls. The expression of 21 miRNA was > two-fold higher, and of 17 miRNA < three-fold lower in βT-EVs than control-EVs. RT-qPCR confirmed differential expression of six miRNAs in βT, particularly miR-144-3p, a regulator of erythropoiesis. Exposure of endothelial, liver Huh7, and pancreatic 1.1B4 cells to βT-EVs significantly reduced cell viability and increased cell apoptosis. βT-EV-induced endothelial cell apoptosis involved the MAPK/JNK signal-transduction pathway. In contrast, splenectomized βT-EVs induced proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC). In summary, the miR-144-3p was strongly increased; βT-EVs induced apoptosis and decreased endothelial, pancreatic, and liver cell survival while supporting BM-MSC proliferation. These mechanisms may contribute to βT organ dysfunction and complications.",2021,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult', 'beta-Thalassemia/*complications/genetics/*metabolism']",34575936,hsa-mir-144,No
5,Human genetics and neuropathology suggest a link between miR-218 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathophysiology.,"Motor neuron-specific microRNA-218 (miR-218) has recently received attention because of its roles in mouse development. However, miR-218 relevance to human motor neuron disease was not yet explored. Here, we demonstrate by neuropathology that miR-218 is abundant in healthy human motor neurons. However, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) motor neurons, miR-218 is down-regulated and its mRNA targets are reciprocally up-regulated (derepressed). We further identify the potassium channel Kv10.1 as a new miR-218 direct target that controls neuronal activity. In addition, we screened thousands of ALS genomes and identified six rare variants in the human miR-218-2 sequence. miR-218 gene variants fail to regulate neuron activity, suggesting the importance of this small endogenous RNA for neuronal robustness. The underlying mechanisms involve inhibition of miR-218 biogenesis and reduced processing by DICER. Therefore, miR-218 activity in motor neurons may be susceptible to failure in human ALS, suggesting that miR-218 may be a potential therapeutic target in motor neuron disease.",2019 Dec 18,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Motor Neurons/metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Neuropathology/*methods']",31852800,hsa-mir-218-2,No
122,hsa-miR-212 modulates the radiosensitivity of glioma cells by targeting BRCA1.,"Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioma, and the response of patients to radio-therapy varies considerably. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various biological processes. The purpose of the present study was to investigate miRNAs involved in the response to radiation in glioma cell lines. Total RNA was isolated from human glioma U251 cells 30 min after gamma-ray exposure and hybridized to an miRNA chip array. miRNA expression profiles were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. pcDNA3/EGFP-miR-212 mimic transfection was used to verify the function of miR-212 in colony formation tests, and the effect of miR-212 overexpression on U251 cells was examined by western blot analysis of apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and cytochrome c). The target genes of miR-212 were predicted using bioinformatic tools including miRNA databases, and breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) was selected for further confirmation by EGFP fluorescence reporter and loss- and gain-of-function assays. Of the 16 candidate miRNAs showing altered expression, five were assessed by real-time PCR; miR-212 was identified as contributing to the radioresistance of glioma cells and was shown to attenuate radiation-induced apoptosis. miR-212 negatively regulated BRCA1 expression by interacting with its 3'-untranslated region, suggesting a correlation between BRCA1 expression and radiosensitivity in glioma cells. U-118MG and SHG-44 cell lines were used to confirm these observations. The response of glioma cells to radiation involves the miR-212-mediated modulation of BRCA1 gene expression, suggesting that the miR-212/BRCA1 axis may play a potential role in the radiotherapy of gliomas.",2018 Mar,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'BRCA1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'Glioma/genetics/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Radiation Tolerance/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",29286157,hsa-mir-212,Yes
143,MicroRNA expression aids the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic ductal,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate microRNA (miRNA) expression in pancreatic resection specimens and fine needle aspiration biopsies and determine which, if any, miRNAs aid the distinction between benign and malignant pancreatic tumors in limited cytology material. METHODS: Resection specimens containing adenocarcinoma (n = 17), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (n = 11), and nonneoplastic tissues (n = 15) were evaluated for miR-21, miR-221, miR-100, miR-155, and miR-181b expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and a subset of carcinomas and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms was analyzed with miRNA microarrays. Cellblocks containing carcinoma (n = 26) or benign pancreatic lesions (n = 11) from fine needle aspiration biopsies were subjected to qRT-PCR for miR-21, miR-221, miR-181b, miR-196a, and miR-217. RESULTS: Carcinomas showed higher expression of miR-21, miR-221, miR-155, miR-100, and miR-181b than benign lesions by qRT-PCR, and overexpression of miR-21, miR-221, and miR-181b was confirmed by microarray analysis. Cellblocks containing carcinoma showed higher expression of miR-21, miR-221, and miR-196a than those from benign lesions (P < 0.001, P = 0.009, and P < 0.001, respectively).

248,MiR-34c inhibits osteosarcoma metastasis and chemoresistance.,"Studies have shown that miR-34c is associated with metastasis and the chemoresponse of several cancers, but its role in osteosarcoma (OS) is unclear. Here, we investigated the role and mechanism of miR-34c in OS metastasis and chemoresponse. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-34c was significantly decreased in specimens from OS patients with a poor chemoresponse or metastasis compared to those with a good chemoresponse and no metastasis. The inhibition of miR-34c significantly stimulated OS cell invasion and chemoresistance in vitro. In contrast, restoring miR-34c significantly inhibited OS cell invasion and chemoresistance. Furthermore, we identified Notch1 and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) as target genes of miR-34c in OS cells and demonstrated that Notch1 and LEF1 have a major role in the effects of miR-34c on OS cell chemosensitivity and metastasis. Taken together, our data indicate that miR-34c suppresses OS metastasis and chemoresistance by targeting Notch1 and LEF1. Restoring miR-34c may have important implications for the development of strategies for inhibiting metastasis and overcoming OS cell resistance to chemotherapy.",2014 Jun,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism']",24802328,hsa-mir-34c,Yes
393,Rise in antifibrotic and decrease in profibrotic microRNA protect the heart,"BACKGROUND: Physiological pregnancy is associated with volume overload. Unlike cardiac pathologies linked with volume overload, such as mitral or aortic regurgitation, pregnancy is thought to be unrelated to fibrosis of the heart. However, changes in the cardiac extracellular matrix during pregnancy remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the expression of 11 microRNAs associated with cardiac fibrosis (miR-21, miR-26a, miR-26b-5p, miR-29b-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-101a, miR-146a, miR-208a, miR-223 and miR-328) during pregnancy and to compare them with a healthy control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six women in singleton pregnancy (30-36 weeks) and 6 non-pregnant women as a control group were included in the study. Each woman underwent an echocardiographic examination, and had blood pressure on both arms measured and a blood sample taken. MicroRNAs expression was analyzed using Custom TaqMan® Array MicroRNA Cards (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). RESULTS: Median age of the pregnant women was 34 years (range 25-39 years) and of the control group 32 years (range 29-43 years). Median week of pregnancy was 34 years (range 31-36 years). Most of the examined microRNAs had a lower expression in the pregnancy group (fold change 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: In the 3rd trimester of physiological pregnancy, there is a 244% increase in expression of miR-101a and a decrease by 73% in expression of miR-328. Both of these changes can protect against fibrosis during volume overload occurring in physiological pregnancy.",2018,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fibrosis/physiopathology', 'Heart/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Pregnancy/*physiology', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third']",29962114,hsa-mir-21,No
1,Circular RNA hsa_circ_0075542 acts as a sponge for microRNA-1197 to suppress malignant characteristics and promote apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.,"Numerous differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified; however, their roles have not been fully elucidated. Since dysregulated circRNAs may have clinical applications, it is vital to study their expression characteristics, function, and mechanism in prostate cancer cells. The role, regulatory mechanism, and expression of hsa_circ_0075542 were analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that the expression of hsa_circ_0075542 was downregulated in prostate tumor tissues. The functions of prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3 cells were assessed using cell counting kit-8 and transwell assays and flow cytometry analysis. The results of the functional experiments showed that overexpression of hsa_circ_0075542 suppressed cell proliferation, reduced migration and invasiveness capabilities, and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, hsa_circ_0075542 targeted the microRNA-1197 (miR-1197) homeobox C11 (HOXC11) axis by sponging miR-1197. Overexpression of miR-1197 played a tumor-promoting role. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0075542 alleviated the tumor-promoting effect of miR-1197 overexpression In conclusion, hsa_circ_0075542 suppressed malignant characteristics and promoted apoptosis in LNCaP and PC3 cells by acting as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-1197.
